\begin{abstract}
More than 1 billion people live in informal settlements worldwide,
where precarious living conditions pose unique challenges to managing
a COVID-19 outbreak. Taking Northwest Syria as a case-study, we simulated
an outbreak in high-density informal Internally Displaced Persons
(IDP) camps using a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered
model. Expanding on previous studies, taking social conditions and
population health/structure into account, we modeled several interventions
feasible in these settings: moderate self-distancing, self-isolation
of symptomatic cases, and protection of the most vulnerable in “safety
zones”. We considered complementary measures to these interventions
that can be implemented autonomously by these communities, such as
buffer zones, daily health-checks, and carers for isolated individuals,
quantifying their impact on the micro-dynamics of disease transmission.
All interventions significantly reduce outbreak probability and mortality.
Self-distancing reduces mortality by up to 35\% if contacts are reduced
by 50\%. A similar reduction in mortality can be achieved by providing
1 self-isolation tent per 200 people. Protecting the most vulnerable
in a safety zone has synergistic effects with the other interventions
and reduces mortality in the most vulnerable population. Our model
predicts that a combination of all simulated interventions may reduce
mortality by as much as 80\% and delay an outbreak’s peak by more
than three months. Our results highlight the potential for non-medical
interventions to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. Similar measures
may be applicable to controlling COVID-19 in other informal settlements,
particularly IDP camps in conflict regions, around the world.

\section*{Introduction}

\begin{comment}
The COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying in the developing world \cite{Guardian1M}.
In Africa, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading from urban areas to informal
settlements \cite{WHO_AfricaMarks6months}. With more than 1 billion
people living in informal settlements worldwide, urgent action is
needed to contain the virus in these settings, a task which necessarily
involves the engagement of the communities living in them \cite{wilkinson_local_2020}.
\end{comment}

The COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying in regions immersed in protracted
armed conflicts \cite{GuardianWinter}, where large portions of their
populations have become displaced. When the displaced population exceeds
official resettlement and refugee camp capacity, Internally Displaced
Persons (IDPs) must live in informal settlements (hereafter named
``camps''). These regions must contend with the public health challenges
resulting from violence \cite{abbas_migrant_2018}, the deterioration
of health-systems \cite{hill_conflict_2010}, especially of critical
care \cite{sahloul_war_2016}, and the breakdown of essential public
infrastructure such as water and sanitation systems \cite{sikder_water_2018}.
Urgent action is needed to contain the virus in these settings, a
task which necessarily involves the engagement of the communities
living in them \cite{wilkinson_local_2020}.

This study focuses on the Northwest region of Syria (NWS): a relatively
small geographical area with 4.2 million people, of which 1.15 million
(27.4\%) are IDPs living in camps \cite{Health_directorate}, and
where the number of cases increased twenty-fold between September
8th and October 20th, 2020 \cite{UNOCHA_collapse}. The health status
of households in camps in NWS is poor; 24\% have a member with a chronic
disease, of whom 41\% have no access to medicines \cite{noauthor_syria_nodate}.
As in other conflict regions, the political instability in NWS hinders
coordinated public health actions, and the ongoing movements of IDPs
create ample opportunity for infectious disease transmission, while
making contact tracing interventions infeasible.

To investigate feasible COVID-19 prevention interventions in the camps,
we considered a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model similar
to the one presented in \cite{gatto_spread_2020}, in which the camps'
populations are divided into classes reflecting their estimated age-structures
and comorbidity prevalence. We use this model to propose various interventions
aimed at reducing the number of contacts within and between population
classes in general, and with symptomatic individuals in particular.
We paid special attention to how the living conditions in informal
camps inform the assumptions underlying our proposed interventions,
a question often neglected \cite{rhodes_Model2context_2020}. We modeled
interventions previously proposed for African cities \cite{vanzandvoort2020},
such as self-distancing, isolation of symptomatic individuals and
the creation of a 'safety zone' in which more vulnerable members of
the population are protected from exposure to the virus.

Building upon the approach used to model the impact of these interventions
in African cities, our model includes a parameterization of the contacts
each individual has per day \cite{vanzandvoort2020}. We further elaborate
upon this approach by making a more explicit representation of contacts
and other parameters in the model. We consider the micro-dynamics
of contacts, the time that individuals take to recognize their symptoms
before self-isolating, the effect of having carers to attend to isolated
individuals, and the existence of a buffer zone in which exposed and
protected population classes can interact under certain rules. We
examine a potential worst-case scenario in which there is no access
to any healthcare facility. Since empowering local communities in
conflict regions to understand how to control COVID-19 is possibly
the most (and perhaps only) effective way to minimize its spread,
our models are of utmost importance for informing the implementation
of realistic interventions in these regions.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{The model}

We considered a discrete-time stochastic model, simulating a viral
outbreak in a single camp over a 12-month period. The model, adapted
for NWS IDP camps is divided into compartments containing individuals
at different possible stages along the disease's progression \cite{gatto_spread_2020}
(see Supplementary Fig. \ref{fig:Diagram}), and splits the population
into classes by age and comorbidity status. Each population class
has specific parameters, and we considered the frequency of contacts
between and within population classes to model transmissivity (see
section Transmissibility assumptions Subsection). Working with population
classes allow us to encode in the model behavioural assumptions with
an appropriate balance between the specificity needed in the model
to realistically evaluate the interventions, its generality, and its
computational tractability \cite{funk_BehaviourInModels_2015}. Moreover,
the explicit representation of contacts between and within population
classes, allowed us to design the interventions considering cultural
and context-based assumptions \cite{rhodes_Model2context_2020} (see
section Interventions and Supplementary Material for details).

Our simulations start with a completely susceptible population where
one person is exposed to the virus. The disease in exposed individuals
progresses through a preclinical infectious stage, followed by either
a clinical (symptomatic) or subclinical (asymptomatic) infectious
stage, resolving through recovery or death. Additional susceptible
individuals become infected through contact with infectious individuals.
We verified that a steady state was always reached before the end
of each simulation. We did not consider migration, births, nor deaths
due to other causes, since they are small enough in magnitude to not
significantly impact the course of an outbreak, provided additional
conflict does not erupt.

\subsection*{Population structure}

We parameterized the model with data from IDPs in NWS \cite{noauthor_syrian_nodate}.
The population sizes of informal camps are approximately log-normally
distributed, with a mean of of 1212. We simulated camps with populations
of 500, 1000 and 2000 individuals. Since interventions tend to be
less effective in larger camps, the results presented refer to simulations
with 2000 individuals, unless otherwise specified. We considered 3
age groups: children (age 1, 0-12 years old), younger adults (age
2, 13-50 yrs) and older adults (age 3, \textgreater 50 yrs). For
ages 2 and 3, we considered two subclasses comprising healthy individuals
and individuals with comorbidities. The fraction of a simulated camp's
population in each of these 5 classes is shown in Supplementary Table
\ref{tab:PopParams}.

\subsection*{Epidemiological severity assumptions}

In NWS, there are 4 active and 2 planed COVID-19 referral hospitals,
with a current capacity of 66 ventilators, 74 ICU beds and 355 ward
beds for 4.2 million people \cite{REACH_syriaOverview,UNOCHA_CCTC_numbers}.
Basic estimation predicted a collapse of health facilities 8 weeks
into an outbreak \cite{hariri_SyriaForecast_2020}. Although we do
not have access to official numbers on healthcare occupancy, the currently
reported number of cases suggests that this scenario could already
have been reached \cite{UNOCHA_collapse}. Hence, we considered a
worst-case scenario in which individuals will not have access to healthcare
and assumed that all critical cases (those requiring ICU care) would
die. However, there is greater uncertainty about the fate of severe
cases, those requiring hospitalization but not ICU care. We therefore
considered a compartment for severe cases to account for a longer
infectious period if they stay in the camp. This compartment also
helped us model some interventions more realistically, for example
by noting that the symptoms of severe cases are incompatible with
self-isolation. To estimate upper and lower bounds for the outcome
variables of our model, we simulated two possible scenarios for the
fate of this compartment: one in which all cases recover, and another
in which all die. In the simulations presented in the Main Text, we
consider the worst-case scenario in which all of these cases die.

The fractions of symptomatic cases that are severe or critical are
class-specific (parameters $h_{i}$ and $g_{i}$, see Supplementary
Table \ref{tab:PopParams}). We estimated these parameters using data
from developed countries with superior population health \cite{dong2020epidemiological,covid2020preliminary}.
Following previous work \cite{vanzandvoort2020}, we mapped the case
severity distributions of NW Syrian adult population classes, to those
of 10 years older age groups in developed countries.

\subsection*{Transmissibility assumptions}

We assumed presymptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic and hospitalized
individuals were equally infectious. We obtained the duration individuals
spend in each compartment from the literature (see Supplementary Table
\ref{tab:FixedParams}). Inspired by previously proposed models \cite{gatto_spread_2020,vanzandvoort2020},
each individual's contact rate (see Supplementary Table \ref{tab:PopParams})
is class-specific, and was estimated from conversations with camp
managers in NWS. The probability of random interaction with an individual
from each class is proportional to this class' fraction of the population.
The product of these two values is the contact rate between two respective
classes.

The probability of infection from contact with an infectious individual,
$\tau$, was estimated from a Gaussian distribution of the basic reproduction
number, $R_{0}$, with a mean of 4 (99\% CI: 3--5). This distribution
was a compromise between values reported in the literature from regions
with high-density informal settlements: $R_{0}$=2.77 in Abuja and
3.44 in Lagos, Nigeria \cite{oyinlola_empirical_2020}, 3.3 in Buenos
Aires \cite{santos_numerical_2020}, and 5 in Rohingya refugee camps
in Bangladesh \cite{truelove_potential_2020}. The probability distribution
of $\tau$ was estimated by randomly generating a value for $R_{0}$,
and dividing this value by the real part of the main eigenvalue of
the Next Generation Matrix (see Supplementary Material).

\subsection*{Interventions}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/Fig1}

\caption{\textbf{\label{fig:Interventions}Diagram of interventions.}}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection*{Self-distancing}

The first non-medical intervention that we modeled is a reduction
in the mean number of contacts per individual per day for the whole
camp population (see Fig. \ref{fig:Interventions}-1). Each individual’s
contact rate (see Supplementary Table \ref{tab:PopParams}) is age
group-specific and was estimated from conversations with camp managers
in NWS. Since the mean number of inhabitants per tent in a camp is
5.5 and sanitation facilities are shared \cite{noauthor_syrian_nodate},
we inferred that the number of contacts per day cannot be reduced
by more than 50\%.For a younger adult, this would mean 7.5 contacts
per day.

\subsubsection*{Self-isolation}

Self-isolation is a challenge in informal settlements, where households
consist of a single (often small) space, water is collected at designated
locations, sanitation facilities are communal and food supplies are
scarce. We considered the possibility of those showing symptoms self-isolating
in individual tents in dedicated parts of the camps. We simulated
this intervention with various numbers of isolation tents per camp,
ranging from 10 to 2000 for a camp of 2000 people (see Fig. \ref{fig:Interventions}-2).
In addition, we modeled the role of carers dedicated to providing
for isolated individuals (see Fig. \ref{fig:Interventions}-2a). Interactions
between carers and isolated individuals were restricted to buffer
zones, which we envisioned as open spaces, with guidelines in place
to limit occupancy to 4 individuals wearing masks, with 2 meters separating
individuals, where the probability of transmission is reduced by 80\%
(see Supplementary Material). In considering one carer per isolated
individual with one contact per day, we do not neglect their probability
of infecting the rest of the camp. We also considered minimum time
intervals for individuals to recognize their symptoms: with means
of 12, 24 and 48 hours (see Fig. \ref{fig:Interventions}-2b).

\subsubsection*{Safety zone}

In this intervention, the camp is divided in two areas: a safety zone,
in which more vulnerable people live (hereby referred to as a “green”
zone following previous studies \cite{vanzandvoort2020}), and an
exposed (“orange”) zone with the remaining population. In our simulations,
the first exposed individual always belongs to the orange zone. The
living conditions within both zones remain the same, so the overall
contact rate does not change unless self-distancing is also implemented.
In practice, reducing the contact rate with individuals living in
a different zone implies an increase in the contact rate with individuals
in the same zone (see Supplementary Material). This allows us to investigate
undesired side-effects of this intervention. Since proposals for partitioning
the population may be received differently across camps, we considered
several scenarios for allocating a camp population to the two zones
(see Fig. \ref{fig:Interventions}-3, Supplementary Table \ref{tab:SafetyScenarios}).

Interactions between the two zones are limited to a buffer zone (see
previous section). Individuals in the green zone cannot leave and
thus need to be provided with supplies by individuals in the orange
zone. Delivery of supplies will take place in the buffer zone. In
our simulations, we considered limiting individuals in the green zone
to 10 or 2 contacts with individuals from the orange zone per week
(see Fig. \ref{fig:Interventions}-3a). Other variations of this intervention
we explored include preventing symptomatic individuals from entering
the buffer zone (see Fig. \ref{fig:Interventions}-3b) and a “lockdown”
of the green zone, where the number of weekly contacts in the buffer
zone is reduced by 50\% or 90\% (see Fig. \ref{fig:Interventions}-3c).

\subsubsection*{Evacuation}

The last intervention we simulated is the evacuation of severe cases
(individuals in the hospitalization compartment). Since they require
more intensive care that cannot be delivered while adhering to the
guidelines of a buffer zone, severe cases were assumed to be fully
infectious and not able to self-isolate. Once severe cases are evacuated,
their infectivity is reduced to zero (see Fig. \ref{fig:Interventions}-4).
The fate of severe cases is not altered by this intervention since
we assumed that hospitals are saturated and that evacuees are transferred
to isolation centers instead.

\subsection*{Statistical analysis}

For each implementation of the interventions, we ran 500 simulations
and compared results between them. The main variables considered are
the fraction of simulations in which at least one death is observed,
a proxy for the probability of an outbreak, the fraction of the population
that dies and the time until the symptomatic population peaks, as
well as the infection fatality rate (IFR) and fraction of the population
that recovers. For consistency, we only considered simulations in
which there was an outbreak when comparing the outcome of a variable
between interventions. We used the Shapiro-Wilk test \cite{shapiro_analysis_1965}
to verify that our results do not exhibit normally distributed residuals,
Kruskal-Wallis test for pairwise comparisons \cite{kruskal_ranks_1952},
and Conover-Iman test for multiple comparisons \cite{conover_multiple_1979}.
The model and all statistical analyses were implemented in R; we used
the package PMCMRplus \cite{pohlert_pmcmr_2020}. All the code and
results are freely available at the url https://github.com/crowdfightcovid19/req-550-Syria.

\section*{Results}

In the absence of interventions, the mean IFR is $\sim$2\% in simulations
where all severe cases requiring hospitalization recover (see Supplementary
Fig. \ref{fig:Suppl_DvsR}), and $\sim$11\% in simulations where
all severe cases die. We consider the latter scenario to evaluate
the effect of non-medical preventive interventions. In this scenario,
the probability of observing an outbreak is close to 0.85, in which
$\sim$10\% of the camp dies, the number of symptomatic cases peaks
after 55 days and $\sim$84\% of the population recovers.

\subsection*{Self-distancing}

Our results show that self-distancing has a notable effect on reducing
the probability of an outbreak: a 20\% reduction in daily contacts
is associated with a $\sim$10\% decrease in outbreak probability
(see Fig. \ref{fig:Panel2}A). A greater reduction in daily contacts,
of 50\%, is required to observe a significant decrease in mortality,
of as much as 35\% (see Fig. \ref{fig:Panel2}B). Self-distancing
also significantly extends the time until the peak of the outbreak,
from 55 days when there is no intervention to 110 days when contacts
are reduced by 50\% (see Fig. \ref{fig:Panel2}C). However, the proportion
of the population recovered after 12 months is reduced by $\sim$30\%
(see Supplementary Fig. \ref{fig:Suppl_self}).

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/Fig2}

\caption{\label{fig:Panel2} \textbf{Effect of interventions on outbreak probability,
fatalities and time until symptomatic cases peak.} A: Self-distancing,
probability of an outbreak. B: Self-distancing, fraction of the population
dying. C: Self-distancing, time until peak symptomatic cases. D: Self-isolation,
probability of an outbreak. E: Self-isolation, fraction of the population
dying. F: Self-isolation, time until peak symptomatic cases. G: Safety
zone, probability of an outbreak. H: Safety zone, fraction of the
population dying. I: Safety zone, time until peak symptomatic cases.
Note that in figures of the safety zone intervention (panels G-I),
the mean of an outcome for the whole population is not the weighted
mean of the exposed and safety zones, since outcomes are computed
considering simulations in which at least one death was observed in
the population class inhabiting the zone. This explains why in panel
I there is a reduction in the mean time until symptomatic cases peak
when moving from 10 to 2 contacts per week for the whole population,
despite there being an increase in the safety zone: in $\sim$35\%
of simulations there is an outbreak in the orange zone but not in
the green zone (panel G).}
\end{figure*}


\subsection*{Self-isolation}

With only 10 tents for a camp of 2000 people (i.e. 1 tent for every
200 people), self-isolation yields a modest decrease in the probability
of observing an outbreak (see Fig. \ref{fig:Panel2}D), but a stronger
reduction in mortality ($\sim$30\%) (see Fig. \ref{fig:Panel2}E).
Further increasing the number of tents significantly augments this
reduction until there is 1 per every 20 people (Kruskal-Conover post-hoc-test,
p-val$<3\times10^{-5}$). However, mortality begins to slightly increase
again after this threshold. This effect and the increase in the probability
of observing an outbreak are consequences of having one carer per
individual isolated (see Supplementary Material), so when the isolated
(infected) population increases, the number of healthy younger adults
in contact with them increases in tandem. Similarly, we observe a
reduction in IFR when increasing the number of tents up to 1 per every
20 people, and no significant reduction over that number (see Supplementary
Fig. \ref{fig:Suppl_isolation}). Importantly, the potential reductions
in overall fatalities and IFR from self-isolation are realized whether
the time required for individuals to recognize their symptoms is 12h
or 24h on average, but the intervention becomes less effective when
this time increases to 48h (see Supplementary Fig. \ref{fig:Suppl_onset}).

\subsection*{Safety zone}

In this section, we consider the scenario in which all older adults,
younger adults with comorbidities and their family members up to 20\%
of the camp population live in the green zone, unless otherwise specified.
Creating a green zone improves the effect of the previous interventions
overall, but with sometimes opposite outcomes in the exposed and protected
populations. For example, the probability of an outbreak sharply decreases
for the protected population, by almost 40\%, if only two contacts
are allowed per week in the buffer zone (see Fig. \ref{fig:Panel2}G).
Notably, most of this reduction is only achieved when health-checks
excluding symptomatic individuals from the buffer zone are in place
(see Supplementary Fig. \ref{fig:Suppl_Tcheck}). On the other hand,
the probability of an outbreak may slightly increase for the exposed
population, a consequence of the relative increase in intra-zone contacts.
Despite this side-effect, by shifting the burden of an outbreak towards
the less vulnerable population in the orange zone, this intervention
not only reduces fatalities among the more vulnerable population in
the green zone (Kruskal-Wallis test, p-val$<10^{-15}$; see Supplementary
Fig. \ref{fig:Suppl_agegroups}), but also reduces the overall IFR
(see Supplementary Fig. \ref{fig:Suppl_safety}) and thus the number
of fatalities globally (see Fig. \ref{fig:Panel2}H). Another important
outcome of this intervention is the notable increase in time until
the number of symptomatic cases peaks for the vulnerable population
(see Fig. \ref{fig:Panel2}I).

Considering different scenarios for allocating people to the green
zone, the lowest probability of an outbreak is achieved when only
older adults or at most older adults and younger adults with comorbidities
move there (see Supplementary Fig. \ref{fig:Suppl_popClass}). Positive
effects of the green zone intervention are even more marked in camps
with smaller populations, for every outcome of interest except time
until symptomatic cases peak (see Supplementary Fig. \ref{fig:Suppl_popSize}).
The incorporation of a lockdown has the greatest effect on reducing
the probability of an outbreak in the green zone, to under 0.10 when
contacts in the buffer zone are reduced by 90\%. While lockdowns show
no positive effect on green zone fatalities in the few instances where
an outbreak does reach there, they decrease IFR and overall fatalities
by further concentrating outbreaks in the less vulnerable population
(see Supplementary Fig. \ref{fig:Suppl_lockdown}).

\subsection*{Evacuation}

We observe no significant effects when severe cases requiring hospitalization
are evacuated (see Supplementary Fig. \ref{fig:Suppl_evacuation}).
Since we considered that these individuals will not receive health
care (they are evacuated to isolation centers), their fate remains
the same than if staying in the camp and, hence, we expect evacuation
to have an effect only in reducing the infectivity. Although these
individuals spend a longer period being infectious with respect to
an individual having mild symptoms ($\sim$10 days longer), the number
of individuals under these conditions is only a small fraction of
the total infectious population at any given time, what explains why
we do not observe significant effects for this intervention.

\subsection*{Combined interventions}

The effects of the interventions observed when we examine them individually
build upon each other when multiple interventions are implemented
in tandem (see Fig. \ref{fig:Panel3} and Supplementary Fig. \ref{fig:Suppl_combined}).
The protective effects of the safety zone intervention especially
are most fully realized not when implemented on its own, but when
paired with other interventions. They become so effective that outbreaks
in the green zone become exceptionally rare, but so well controlled
when they do happen, that the majority of outbreaks see fewer than
20 cases. This leads to an anomalous increase in IFR in some of the
most effective interventions, driven by the discretization of the
values it can take (Supplementary Table. \ref{tab:CFR_discrete}).
When all interventions are implemented together: strict self-distancing
(50\% reduction in contacts), self-isolation of symptomatic cases
(1 tent for every 40 people), a safety zone with 2 contacts per week
in the buffer zone, health checks, a strict lockdown (90\%), and evacuation
of severe cases, mortality is reduced by $\sim$80\%.

\section*{Discussion}

In this study, we propose a number of interventions of immediate applicability
to informal settlements. We focused on IDP settlements in NW Syria,
taking into account the interventions' feasibility, cultural acceptance
and their need for low-cost. When confronted with different possible
scenarios, we generally considered the worst-cases, highlighting the
interventions that are most effective in the direst conditions, but
possibly resulting in an overestimate of mortality. This potential
overestimation does not change the qualitative picture of the results,
which is built upon the analysis of relative values between the presence
and absence of interventions.

Our results align with previous simulation studies of potential COVID-19
interventions in similarly densely populated, low-resource settings
where informal settlements are present, such as urban areas of sub-Saharan
Africa. In these settings, social-distancing is demonstrated to be
an effective intervention, and even small changes are estimated to
have large effects on outbreaks \cite{nyabadza2020}, in some cases
determining whether or not already inadequate healthcare systems become
overwhelmed \cite{siraj_early_2020}. Zandvoort et al. show that similar
measures to the ones we consider: self-isolation, physical distancing
and ``shielding'' the vulnerable, may reduce mortality by 60\%-75\%
in African cities \cite{vanzandvoort2020}.

Self-distancing proves to be an effective measure in our models as
well; reducing contacts by 50\% has the greatest effect across most
outcomes of interest in any of the interventions we examined. However,
the difficulty of achieving a reduction of this magnitude cannot be
overlooked, especially considering the large proportion of the population
composed of children, a group with an already high contact rate that
may prove difficult to control \cite{noauthor_syrian_nodate}.

We also propose self-isolation using individual tents which can be
located in a dedicated zone or next to the tents of relatives, where
contact with non-isolated individuals is mediated by a buffer zone.
This intervention is effective with even a small number of isolation
tents, as low as 5-10 tents per 1000 camp residents. After conversations
with camp managers, we found that this intervention is more likely
to be accepted in NW Syria than evacuation to community-based isolation
centers. Community-based isolation not only poses cultural challenges;
the capacity required to implement it has hardly been met \cite{UNOCHA_CCTC_numbers},
and it is still one of the main challenges in the region \cite{UNOCHA_collapse}.

One of the key parameters we assessed for the implementation of self-isolation
is the need for carers. In considering one carer per isolated individual,
with daily contact in a buffer zone, once a certain threshold of isolated
cases ($\sim$200 per camp of 2000) is surpassed, the benefits of
isolation begin to be outweighed by an increase in infectivity resulting
from a growing number of exposed carers. This pitfall could be circumvented
through the creation of a more organized, dedicated group of carers,
thus reducing the number of healthy younger adults in contact with
isolated (infectious) individuals.

Much of the success or failure of the safety zone intervention hinges
on the functioning of the buffer zone. The number of inter-zone contacts
per week, the implementation of health checks, and potential lockdowns
all have notable effects. Also important is the portion of the population
that is protected; protecting only the vulnerable may have the most
beneficial effects, but it is precisely these vulnerable individuals,
older adults and people with comorbidities, who may most need family
members to care for them. While safety zone scenarios that allow greater
numbers of family members to accompany their vulnerable relatives
to the green zone may confer greater epidemiological risk, they may
also engender greater well-being and social cohesion.

Although setting up a safety zone sharply reduces the probability
of an outbreak in the population classes with the highest IFRs, thus
reducing the IFR of the entire population, it is possible that our
model may overestimate mortality from an outbreak in the green zone
in the few instances when there is one. Since total numbers of contacts
are conserved in our modelization, individuals do not reduce their
contacts when moved to the green zone, which implies an increase in
the number of contacts between vulnerable individuals. Despite this
increase in contacts, we observed a significant reduction in mortality
in the vulnerable population when the safety zone is implemented.
These results address concerns raised around this type of intervention
from previous experiences with large numbers of fatalities registered
in nursing-homes in developed countries \cite{dahab_covidIDPcontrol_2020}.
While in developed countries nursing home residents have more contacts,
both with other vulnerable people (other nursing home residents) and
healthy adults who live in different households (health aids), than
the elderly who live at home, vulnerable people in our proposed green
zone have the same number of total contacts as they would under normal
conditions, but significantly fewer contacts with healthy adults from
different households.

An instrumental consideration for our models is the fraction of the
population recovered from COVID-19 after a steady state is reached.
Although the duration for which SARS-CoV-2 infection confers immunity
is uncertain, the proportion of the population recovered after an
outbreak should play a role in its protection against future ones.
For every intervention except self-distancing of 50\%, we observed
that the fraction of the population recovered meets or exceeds 75\%.

A key limitation of our approach is that it simulates an outbreak
started by one infectious individual in a single camp with a closed
population. We acknowledge that this approach does not fully capture
the complexities of the NWS region, where IDPs live interspersed throughout
the region in several hundred camps. The dynamics of an outbreak in
the region are undoubtedly influenced by inter-community contacts,
and the dynamics of an outbreak in a single camp by these region-wide
dynamics, as it has been demonstrated in other countries \cite{gatto_spread_2020,arenas2020}.
We expect our results to be robust against changes in the population,
as soon as these changes are relatively small compared to the total
population size in the camp, implying punctual inputs of infected
individuals. This is the expected behaviour in IDPs, which are often
small and located in rural areas, and in which important population
movements, as those observed in large camps, are infrequent. This
fact, together with the relatively young population in IDPs, may help
in limiting the impact of the disease, as observed in African rural
areas \cite{diop_COVIDruralAfrica_2020}.

Other unaccounted for social and cultural dynamics will undeniably
complicate the feasibility of our proposed interventions. Only one
example we have not addressed here is the unlikeliness of children
under 13 self-isolating. Although the number of challenges to implementing
our proposed interventions are potentially endless, the community-based
nature of our approach may help circumvent these challenges much faster
than healthcare-based interventions, which often depend on complex
political decisions and may take years to build the requisite capacity
for an effective response. If the dynamics of the virus are well understood
by local communities and at least some of the interventions we propose
are implemented, the impacts of COVID-19 can be mitigated even in
an environment as challenging as NW Syria.

\section*{Conclusion}

Given a rapidly changing environment and slow responses of local and
international authorities, the latter often leaving these communities
aside in their priorities \cite{Mukumbange_refugeesVaccine_2020},
empowering local communities themselves is perhaps the best, if not
the only way, to help them avoid the worst consequences of the pandemic.
This not only applies to IDP camps in NW Syria, but more generally
to refugee camps in conflict-torn regions, and potentially other informal
settlements and vulnerable communities around the world: the low-cost,
effective interventions we present are feasible, needed and urgent.

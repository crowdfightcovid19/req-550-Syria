## Tables and figures
* Take decisions about the panels.
    * Option 1:
    * Table + scheme of the interventions
    * Panel 1. A 3rows x 4cols figures. 
        * Columns: Prob. Outbreak, fraction of deaths, Time to peak, number recovered.
        * Rows: Self-distance, self-isolation, shielding (basic).
    * Panel 2. 
        * 4 rows with each combination of interventions, with a single x axis.

    * Option 2:
    * Table + scheme of the interventions
    * Panel 1. A 3rows x 4cols figures. 
        * Columns: Prob. Outbreak, fraction of deaths, Time to peak, number recovered.
        * Rows: Self-distance, self-isolation, shielding (basic).
    * Panel 2. 
        * Columns: Prob. Outbreak, fraction of deaths, Time to peak, number recovered.
        * Rows: Shielding+lockdown, Shielding+effect type pop shielded, Shielding+effect pop size.
    * Panel 3. 
        * 4 rows with each combination of interventions, with a single x axis.

* Create a nice Table summarizing the interventions, as the Table 1 in Zandvoort.
* Create a decent diagram illustrating the shielding intervention, isolation and evacuation.
* Create new figures if needed.
* Create panels for composite figures.

## Statistical analysis.
* Double check all percentages of increase/decrease of variables stated in the text.
* Test if the difference in the fraction of deaths is significant for 24h vs. 12h in the Onset variable
* Posthoc test for isolation tents, increasing numbers the tents reduces significantly the fraction of deaths? What about CFR? 
* Understand why CFR for shielding increases for the shielded population, remains constant  for the exposed population and decreases for all population.

## Format
* Correct spelling
* Searching in the literature and add to bib file.
* Include refs in the manuscript.

## Contents
(APG -- ongoing)
* Control the use of "camp"
* Reduce text in general, methods in particular. (>800 words now)
* Avoid repeating contents across sections.
* Pay more attention to herd immunity
* More focused discussion.

Note that in figures of the safety zone intervention (panels G-I), the mean of of an outcome for the whole population is not the weighted mean of the exposed and safety zones, since outcomes are computed considering simulations in which at least one death was observed in the population class inhabiting the zone. This explains why in panel I there is a reduction in the mean time until symptomatic cases peak when moving from 10 to 2 contacts per week for the whole population, despite there being an increase in the safety zone: in \textasciitilde 35\% of simulations there is an outbreak in the orange zone but not in the green zone (panel G).}}{7}}

## Versions

* APG will merge the two versions and a new version will be created v0.1 --> v0.2
* The first version to submit will lead to a version v1.0
* When a significant change in the manuscript is made (e.g. change of format to submit to another journal or changes after substantial reviewers comments) a new version will be started, e.g v1.5 --> v2.0 

## Figures

* Symbolic links to figures found in the repo should be located in the folder. The symbolic link should follow the order in which it is called in the paper, e.g. Fig1A, Fig2, etc.

* References should be copied within the .bib file found in the folder (in bib format).

	abstract = {The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy prompted drastic measures for transmission containment. We examine the effects of these interventions, based on modeling of the unfolding epidemic. We test modeling options of the spatially explicit type, suggested by the wave of infections spreading from the initial foci to the rest of Italy. We estimate parameters of a metacommunity Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered (SEIR)-like transmission model that includes a network of 107 provinces connected by mobility at high resolution, and the critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We estimate a generalized reproduction number (R0R0{\textless}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}R{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}0{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater} = 3.60 [3.49 to 3.84]), the spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix that measures the potential spread in the absence of containment interventions. The model includes the implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy (February 21, 2020) and runs until March 25, 2020. We account for uncertainty in epidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and awareness-dependent exposure probabilities. We draw scenarios of different containment measures and their impact. Results suggest that the sequence of restrictions posed to mobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced transmission by 45\% (42 to 49\%). Averted hospitalizations are measured by running scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the imposed restrictions and total about 200,000 individuals (as of March 25, 2020). Although a number of assumptions need to be reexamined, like age structure in social mixing patterns and in the distribution of mobility, hospitalization, and fatality, we conclude that verifiable evidence exists to support the planning of emergency measures.},

	abstract = {Background: Knowing the prevalence of true asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases is critical for designing mitigation measures against the pandemic. We aimed to synthesize all available research on asymptomatic cases and transmission rates. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe PMC for primary studies on asymptomatic prevalence in which (1) the sample frame includes at-risk populations and (2) follow-up was sufficient to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed-effects and random-effects models. We assessed risk of bias by combination of questions adapted from risk of bias tools for prevalence and diagnostic accuracy studies. Results: We screened 2,454 articles and included 13 low risk-of-bias studies from seven countries that tested 21,708 at-risk people, of which 663 were positive and 111 asymptomatic. Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed using a real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction test. The asymptomatic proportion ranged from 4\% to 41\%. Meta-analysis (fixed effects) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 17\% (95\% CI 14\% to 20\%) overall and higher in aged care (20\%; 95\% CI 14\% to 27\%) than in non-aged care (16\%; 95\% CI 13\% to 20\%). The relative risk (RR) of asymptomatic transmission was 42\% lower than that for symptomatic transmission (combined RR 0.58; 95\% CI 0.34 to 0.99, p = 0.047). Conclusions: Our one-in-six estimate of the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission rates is lower than those of many highly publicized studies but still sufficient to warrant policy attention. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in subpopulations such as children, to better understand how asymptomatic cases contribute to the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infection of the respiratory tract that emerged in late 20191,2. Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8\% of cases with severe courses, and 6.1\% of cases with critical courses3. This severe presentation may result from the virus using a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4; the same receptor tropism is thought to have determined the pathogenicity—but also aided in the control—of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20035. However, there are reports of cases of COVID-19 in which the patient shows mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which suggests the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6–8. There is an urgent need for information on virus replication, immunity and infectivity in specific sites of the body. Here we report a detailed virological analysis of nine cases of COVID-19 that provides proof of active virus replication in tissues of the upper respiratory tract. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms, with a peak at 7.11 × 108 RNA copies per throat swab on day 4. Infectious virus was readily isolated from samples derived from the throat or lung, but not from stool samples—in spite of high concentrations of virus RNA. Blood and urine samples never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by the presence of viral replicative RNA intermediates in the throat samples. We consistently detected sequence-distinct virus populations in throat and lung samples from one patient, proving independent replication. The shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50\% of patients (and by day 14 in all patients), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild illness of the upper respiratory tract. The confirmation of active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract has implications for the containment of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Background Long-term shedding of viral RNA in COVID-19 prevents timely discharge from the hospital or de-escalation of infection prevention and control practices. Key questions are the duration and determinants of infectious virus shedding. We assessed these questions using virus cultures of respiratory tract samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients as a proxy for infectious virus shedding.Methods Clinical and virological data were obtained from 129 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (89 intensive care, 40 medium care). Generalized estimating equations were used to identify if viral RNA load, detection of viral subgenomic RNA, serum neutralizing antibody response, duration of symptoms, or immunocompromised status were predictive for a positive virus culture.Findings Infectious virus shedding was detected in 23 of the 129 patients (17,8\%). The median duration of shedding was 8 days post onset of symptoms (IQR 5 – 11) and the probability of detecting infectious virus dropped below 5\% after 15,2 days post onset of symptoms (95\% confidence interval (CI) 13,4 – 17,2). Multivariate analyses identified viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies/mL (odds ratio [OR]; CI 14,7 (3,57-58,1; p\&lt;0,001) as independently associated with isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract. A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0,01 (CI 0,003-0,08; p\&lt;0,001) was independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2.Interpretation Infection prevention and control guidelines should take into account that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 may shed infectious virus for longer periods of time compared to what has been reported for in patients with mild COVID-19. Infectious virus shedding drops to undetectable levels below a viral RNA load threshold and once serum neutralizing antibodies are present, which warrants the use of quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological assays in test-based strategies to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and control precautions.Evidence before this study We searched PubMed, bioRxiv, and medRxiv for articles that reported on shedding of infectious virus in COVID-19 patients using the search terms (“coronavirus” OR “SARS” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “COVID-19”) AND (“shedding” OR “infectivity” OR “infectious” OR “virus culture”) with no language or time restrictions. A detailed study on nine patients with mild COVID-19 reported that infectious virus could not be isolated after more than eight days of symptoms. The probability of isolating infectious virus was less than 5\% when viral loads dropped below 6,51 Log10 RNA copies/mL. Similar results were obtained with a larger diagnostic sample set, but that study did not report on clinical parameters such as disease severity. Finally there is a report of a single patient shedding infectious virus up to 18 days after onset of symptoms. No published works were found on the shedding of infectious virus in patients with severe or critical COVID-19, and no published works were found on factors independently associated with shedding of infectious virus.Added value of this study We assessed the duration and determinants of infectious virus shedding in 129 patients with severe or critical COVID-19. The duration of infectious virus shedding ranged from 0 to 20 days post onset of symptoms (median 8 days, IQR 5 – 11). The probability of detecting infectious virus dropped below 5\% after 15,2 days post onset of symptoms (95\% confidence interval (CI) 13,4 – 17,2). Viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies/mL were independently associated with detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract (odds ratio [OR]; CI 14,7 (3,57-58,1; p\&lt;0,001). A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0,01 (CI 0,003-0,08; p\&lt;0,001) was independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2.Implications of all the available evidence Infection prevention and control guidelines should take into account that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 may shed infectious virus for longer periods of time compared to what has been reported for in patients with mild COVID-19. Quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological assays should be used for test-based strategies to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and control precautions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work partially was funded through EU COVID-19 grant RECOVER 101003589.

	abstract = {Objective To review the evidence from studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 culture, with the results of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods We searched LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 database for Covid-19 using the terms viral culture or viral replication and associated synonyms up to 10 September 2020. We carried out citation matching and included studies reporting attempts to culture or observe SARS-CoV-2 matching with cutoffs for RT-PCR positivity. One reviewer extracted data for each study and a second reviewer checked end edited the extraction and summarised the narratively by sample: fecal, respiratory, environment, blood or mixed. Where necessary we wrote to corresponding authors of the included or background papers for additional information. We assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. This is the fourth version of this review that was first published on the 4th of August and updated on the 21t of August, on the 3rd and 10th of September. Results We included 29 studies reporting culturing or observing tissue invasion by SARS-CoV in sputum, naso or oropharyngeal, urine, stool, blood and environmental samples from patients diagnosed with Covid-19. The data are suggestive of a relation between the time from collection of a specimen to test, cycle threshold and symptom severity. The quality of the studies was moderate with lack of standardised reporting. Twelve studies reported that Ct values were significantly lower and log copies higher in samples producing live virus culture. Five studies reported no growth in samples based on a Ct cut-off value. These values ranged from CT \&gt; 24 for no growth to Ct \&gt; 34 or more. Two studies report a strong relationship between Ct value and ability to recover infectious virus and that the odds of live virus culture reduced by 33\% for every one unit increase in Ct. A cut-off RT-PCR Ct \&gt; 30 was associated with non-infectious samples. One study that analysed the NSP, N and E gene fragments of the PCR result reported different cut-off thresholds depending on the gene fragment analysed. The duration of RNA shedding detected by PCR was far longer compared to detection of live culture. Six out of eight studies reported RNA shedding for longer than 14 days. Yet, infectivity declines after day 8 even among cases with ongoing high viral loads. A very small proportion of people re-testing positive after hospital discharge or with high Ct are likely to be infectious. Conclusion Prospective routine testing of reference and culture specimens are necessary for each country involved in the pandemic to establish the usefulness and reliability of PCR for Covid-19 and its relation to patient factors. Infectivity is related to the date of onset of symptoms and cycle threshold level. A binary Yes / No approach to the interpretation RT-PCR unvalidated against viral culture will result in false positives with possible segregation of large numbers of people who are no longer infectious and hence not a threat to public health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Protocolshttps://www.cebm.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Protocol-Analysis-of-Transmission-Dynamics-of-COVID-1.pdfFunding StatementThe reviews was partly funded by NIHR Evidence Synthesis Working Group project 380 and supported by the Maria and David Willets foundation.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Not applicable.

	abstract = {Importance Knowing the transmissibility of asymptomatic infections and risk of infection from household and community exposures is critical to SARS-CoV-2 control. Limited previous evidence is based primarily on virologic testing, which disproportionately misses mild and asymptomatic infections. Serologic measures are more likely to capture all previously infected individuals.Objective Estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from household and community exposures, and identify key risk factors for transmission and infection.Design Household serosurvey and transmission model.Setting Population-based serosurvey in Geneva, SwitzerlandParticipants 4,524 household members five years and older from 2,267 households enrolled April-June 2020.Exposures SARS-CoV-2 infected (seropositive) household members and background risk of community transmission.Main outcomes and measures Past SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed through anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by ELISA. Chain-binomial models based on the number of infections within households were used to estimate extra-household infection risk by demographics and reported extra-household contacts, and infection risk from exposure to an infected household member by demographics and infector’s symptoms. Infections attributable to exposure to different types of infectious individuals were estimated.Results The chance of being infected by a single SARS-CoV-2 infected household member was 17.2\% (95\%CrI 13.6-21.5\%) compared to a cumulative extra-household infection risk of 5.1\% (95\%CrI 4.5-5.8\%). Infection risk from an infected household member increased with age, from 7.5\% (95\%CrI 1.3-20.3\%) among 5-9 years to 30.2\% (95\%CrI 14.3-48.2\%) among those ≥65 years. Working-age adults (20-49 years) had the highest extra-household infection risk. Seropositive household members not reporting symptoms had 74.8\% lower odds (95\%CrI 43.8-90.3\%) of infecting another household member compared to those reporting symptoms, accounting for 19.6\% (95\%CrI 12.9-24.5\%) of all household infections.Conclusions and Relevance The risk of infection from exposure to a single infected household member was four-times that of extra-household exposures over the first wave of the pandemic. Young children had a lower risk from infection from household members. Asymptomatic infections are far less likely to transmit than symptomatic ones but do cause infections. While the small households in Geneva limit the contribution of household spread, household transmission likely plays a greater role in other settings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study grants from Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, Swiss School of Public Health (Corona Immunitas research program), Fondation de Bienfaisance du Groupe Pictet, Fondation Ancrage, Fondation Privee des Hopitaux Universitaires de Geneve, and Center for Emerging Viral Diseases.

	abstract = {Background COVID-19 could have even more dire consequences in refugees camps than in general populations. Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with 600,000 concentrated in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site (mean age, 21 years; standard deviation [SD], 18 years; 52\% female). Projections of the potential COVID-19 burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical for preparedness planning. Methods and findings To explore the potential impact of the introduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature and age as the primary determinant of infection severity. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. From the simulated infections, we estimated hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected, age-adjusted for the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site age distribution. Our findings suggest that a large-scale outbreak is likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp, with 61\%–92\% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 people infected across scenarios. On average, in the first 30 days of the outbreak, we expect 18 (95\% prediction interval [PI], 2–65), 54 (95\% PI, 3–223), and 370 (95\% PI, 4–1,850) people infected in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. These reach 421,500 (95\% PI, 376,300–463,500), 546,800 (95\% PI, 499,300–567,000), and 589,800 (95\% PI, 578,800–595,600) people infected in 12 months, respectively. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 55–136 days, between the low and high transmission scenarios. We estimate 2,040 (95\% PI, 1,660–2,500), 2,650 (95\% PI, 2,030–3,380), and 2,880 (95\% PI, 2,090–3,830) deaths in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. Due to limited data at the time of analyses, we assumed that age was the primary determinant of infection severity and hospitalization. We expect that comorbidities, limited hospitalization, and intensive care capacity may increase this risk; thus, we may be underestimating the potential burden. Conclusions Our findings suggest that a COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure that may exceed what is currently feasible in these settings. Detailed and realistic planning for the worst case in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now. Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems.},

	abstract = {This paper highlights the major challenges and considerations for addressing COVID-19 in informal settlements. It discusses what is known about vulnerabilities and how to support local protective action. There is heightened concern about informal urban settlements because of the combination of population density and inadequate access to water and sanitation, which makes standard advice about social distancing and washing hands implausible. There are further challenges to do with the lack of reliable data and the social, political and economic contexts in each setting that will influence vulnerability and possibilities for action. The potential health impacts of COVID-19 are immense in informal settlements, but if control measures are poorly executed these could also have severe negative impacts. Public health interventions must be balanced with social and economic interventions, especially in relation to the informal economy upon which many poor urban residents depend. Local residents, leaders and community-based groups must be engaged and resourced to develop locally appropriate control strategies, in partnership with local governments and authorities., Historically, informal settlements and their residents have been stigmatized, blamed, and subjected to rules and regulations that are unaffordable or unfeasible to adhere to. Responses to COVID-19 should not repeat these mistakes. Priorities for enabling effective control measures include: collaborating with local residents who have unsurpassed knowledge of relevant spatial and social infrastructures, strengthening coordination with local governments, and investing in improved data for monitoring the response in informal settlements.},

	abstract = {The 2015–2017 global migratory crisis saw unprecedented numbers of people on the move and tremendous diversity in terms of age, gender and medical requirements. This article focuses on key emerging public health issues around migrant populations and their interactions with host populations. Basic needs and rights of migrants and refugees are not always respected in regard to article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 23 of the Refugee Convention. These are populations with varying degrees of vulnerability and needs in terms of protection, security, rights, and access to healthcare. Their health status, initially conditioned by the situation at the point of origin, is often jeopardised by adverse conditions along migratory paths and in intermediate and final destination countries. Due to their condition, forcibly displaced migrants and refugees face a triple burden of non-communicable diseases, infectious diseases, and mental health issues. There are specific challenges regarding chronic infectious and neglected tropical diseases, for which awareness in host countries is imperative. Health risks in terms of susceptibility to, and dissemination of, infectious diseases are not unidirectional. The response, including the humanitarian effort, whose aim is to guarantee access to basic needs (food, water and sanitation, healthcare), is gripped with numerous challenges. Evaluation of current policy shows insufficiency regarding the provision of basic needs to migrant populations, even in the countries that do the most. Governments around the world need to rise to the occasion and adopt policies that guarantee universal health coverage, for migrants and refugees, as well as host populations, in accordance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. An expert consultation was carried out in the form of a pre-conference workshop during the 4th International Conference on Prevention and Infection Control (ICPIC) in Geneva, Switzerland, on 20 June 2017, the United Nations World Refugee Day.},

Within a few short years, the life expectancy of resident Syrians has declined by 20 years. Over the first 4 years of the conflict, more than 75,000 civilians died from injuries incurred in the violence. More than twice as many civilians, including many women and children, have died prematurely of infectious and noninfectious chronic diseases for want of adequate health care. Doctors, local administrators, and nongovernmental organizations are struggling to manage the consequences of the conflict under substandard conditions, often using unorthodox methods of health care delivery in field hospitals and remotely by telehealth communication. Much-needed medical supplies are channeled through dangerous routes across the borders from Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey. Physicians in the United States and other western nations have helped Syrian physicians make the most of the situation by providing training on introducing innovations in technology and treatment. Portable ultrasound machines have been introduced and are being used extensively in the management of trauma and shock. This report, prepared by members of the Syrian American Medical Society, documents current needs for health care relief within Syria, focusing on pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine, and some of the efforts currently underway to meet those needs.},

	abstract = {The world greeted the New Year 2020 with varying degrees of optimism. Overall, forecasts for 2020 were made with cautious optimism given the global slowdown in 2019. While at this, the Chinese city of Wuhan was being ravaged by a deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 disease. The disease described by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic has dealt a severe blow on the health system and economic activities on a global scale. Substantial uncertainties surround the appreciation of the precise nature of the health challenge, its spread over time and other aspects all of which further complicate the deployment of appropriate measures in clinical interventions as well as dampen the effectiveness of broader macroeconomic policies especially for the developing countries with their multifarious structural weaknesses. This paper explored the nature of the COVID-19 both in terms of the shape of its growth curve and then estimated the basic reproduction number on the one hand, while also providing forecast of the path of the pandemic, particularly the number of infections for Nigeria. The Poisson, Negative Binomial and Wallinga and Teunis (2004) modelling techniques were used on data from Nigeria. As at April 28, 2020, the COVID-19 curve for Nigeria was upward sloping in nature with the steepness becoming marked from around 30 March 2020. This was about the same period that government ordered the lockdown of the epicentres of the pandemic. Also, the basic reproduction number was both time variant and relatively high for the national (2.25) and subnational [Lagos (3.44) and Abuja (2.77)] cases. The projections from the two standard models suggested that the incidence of infections may just begin to taper off by the end of the second quarter before stabilising at about the third quarter of 2020. This is suggestive of huge trade-offs with respect to losses in potential GDP and thereby of the need for government and other stakeholders to come up with proactive steps to mitigate the severity and reduce the duration of the imminent economic recession that will culminate.},

	abstract = {An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 25. We calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 \%, and 2.36 \% if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 \%. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 \%), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Introduction: There is limited research on how the COVD-19 pandemic will affect countries with weakened health systems and particularly those in conflict. Syria protracted conflict has strained its health systems and caused fragmentation. In this study, we focus on northwest (NW) Syria, where recent violence has driven almost one million civilians (of the 4.17 million in the area) from their homes between December 2019 and March 2020. The area is challenged by overcrowding, inadequate WASH, shelter and insufficient healthcare services. Internationally promoted measures (social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine, lockdown) are not impossible. We model outcomes, according to three scenarios, should there be a COVD-19 outbreak. We aim to: 1. Predict the numbers of cases, including severe and critical ones, and deaths. 2. Identify critical time points when the health system capacity is overwhelmed due to COVID-19. Methodology: using the WHO COVD-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool (COVID-ESFT) and data from the Health Information System Unit on population and health facility capacity and utilization in northwest Syria, we generate predicted numbers of cases, deaths and health care needs according to three scenarios. Scenario One assumes a medium doubling rate (every 4 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20\% of the population). Scenario Two assumes a fast doubling rate (every 3.2 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20\% of the population). Camp-population Scenario assumes a very fast doubling rate (every 2.3 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20\% of the population). Scenarios One and Two apply to the total population of 4.17 million and for 8 weeks from the first case while Camp-population Scenario applies only to the 1.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps and tented settlements and for 6 weeks from the first case. For each scenario, we identify critical time-points when the health system capacity is overwhelmed assuming a highly conservative estimate that 50\% of regular hospital (ward) and ICU beds can be occupied by COVID-19 patients. Results: Scenario One predicts 16,384 cases (0.4\% of the total population), of which 2,458 are severe and 819 are critical, and 978 deaths in the first 8 weeks. Scenario Two predicts 185,364 cases (4.4\% of the population), of which 27805 are severe and 9268 are critical, and 11,066 deaths in the first 8 weeks. Camp-population Scenario predicts 240,000 cases (20\% of the IDP population) of which 36,000 are severe and 12,000 are critical and 14,328 deaths in the first 6 weeks. With only 2,429 inpatient beds and 240 ICU beds (98 with adult ventilators, 62 with paediatric ventilators) in northwest Syria, ward and ICU bed capacities will be overwhelmed within 4-7 weeks. The Camp-population Scenario will see the earliest critical time-points. Conclusion and recommendations: Should a COVID-19 outbreak occur in NW Syria, projected cases and deaths will be particularly severe among IDPs. Health system capacity will be overwhelmed within a short period after the first case in camp settings. There is need for further research to account for additional variables that can impact projections. However, it is urgent for international community to mobilize efforts and resources to support community-based measures, increase testing, strengthen health system capacity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Introduction Since its emergence in late December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly developed into a pandemic in mid of March with many countries suffering heavy human loss and declaring emergency conditions to contain its spread. The impact of the disease, while it has been relatively low in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as of May 2020, is feared to be potentially devastating given the less developed and fragmented healthcare system in the continent. In addition, most emergency measures practised may not be effective due to their limited affordability as well as the communal way people in SSA live in relative isolation in clusters of large as well as smaller population centres.Methods To address the acute need for estimates of the potential impacts of the disease once it sweeps through the African region, we developed a process-based model with key parameters obtained from recent studies, taking local context into consideration. We further used the model to estimate the number of infections within a year of sustained local transmissions under scenarios that cover different population sizes, urban status, effectiveness and coverage of social distancing, contact tracing and usage of cloth face mask.Results We showed that when implemented early, 50\% coverage of contact tracing and face mask, with 33\% effective social distancing policies can bringing the epidemic to a manageable level for all population sizes and settings we assessed. Relaxing of social distancing in urban settings from 33\% to 25\% could be matched by introduction and maintenance of face mask use at 43\%.Conclusions In SSA countries with limited healthcare workforce, hospital resources and intensive care units, a robust system of social distancing, contact tracing and face mask use could yield in outcomes that prevent several millions of infections and thousands of deaths across the continent.},

The model parameters are calibrated using the number of casualties officially reported. Since infinite solutions honour the data, we show different cases. In all of them the reproduction ratio \$R\_0\$ decreases after early lockdown, but then raises, probably due to an increase in contagion in highly populated slums. Therefore it is mandatory to reverse this growing trend in \$R\_0\$ by applying control strategies to avoid a high number of infectious and dead individuals.

	abstract = {The infectivity profile of an individual with COVID-19 is attributed to the paper Temporal dynamics in viral shedding and transmissibility of COVID-19 by He et al., published in Nature Medicine in April 2020. However, the analysis within this paper contains a mistake such that the published infectivity profile is incorrect and the conclusion that infectiousness begins 2.3 days before symptom onset is no longer supported. In this document we discuss the error and compute the correct infectivity profile. We also establish confidence intervals on this profile, quantify the difference between the published and the corrected profiles, and discuss an issue of normalisation when fitting serial interval data. This infectivity profile plays a central role in policy and decision making, thus it is crucial that this issue is corrected with the utmost urgency to prevent the propagation of this error into further studies and policies. We hope that this preprint will reach all researchers and policy makers who are using the incorrect infectivity profile to inform their work.},

	abstract = {The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is defined as the expected number of secondary infections arising from a single individual during his or her entire infectious period, in a population of susceptibles. This concept is fundamental to the study of epidemiology and within-host pathogen dynamics. Most importantly, R0 often serves as a threshold parameter that predicts whether an infection will spread. Related parameters which share this threshold behaviour, however, may or may not give the true value of R0. In this paper we give a brief overview of common methods of formulating R0 and surrogate threshold parameters from deterministic, non-structured models. We also review common means of estimating R0 from epidemiological data. Finally, we survey the recent use of R0 in assessing emerging diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, a number of recent livestock diseases, and vector-borne diseases malaria, dengue and West Nile virus.},

	abstract = {Viruses and bacteria responsible for infectious diseases often mutate and are carried between geographical regions. We consider a mathematical model which begins to account for these factors. We assume two disjoint populations that only occasionally comingle, and two strains of a disease present in these populations. Of interest are the equations describing the dynamics of this system, the conditions under which epidemics will occur, and the long term behavior of the system under various initial conditions. We ﬁnd general conditions under which a state of disease-free equilibrium is stable; we examine the sensitivity of our system to changes in modeling parameters; and we ﬁnd evidence that two disease strains of unequal strength may coexist in a two population system.},

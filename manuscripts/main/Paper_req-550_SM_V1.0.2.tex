\section{Parameterization of the model}

\subsection{Derivation of fixed parameters (Table \ref{tab:FixedParams} in Main
Text)}

To estimate the latent period ($\nicefrac{1}{\delta_{\EE}}$), we
calculated the difference between randomly generated incubation ($\nicefrac{1}{\delta_{\EE}}+\nicefrac{1}{\delta_{\PP}}$)
and presymptomatic ($\nicefrac{1}{\delta_{\PP}}$) periods. We estimated
the presymptomatic period using results reported by He et al. \cite{he2020temporal}
and found they best fit a Gompertz distribution with a mean of 2.3
days (95\% CI: 0.8-3.0). Since a correction of these by Ashcroft et
al. \cite{ashcroft_covid-19_2020} suggests they significantly underestimate
the presymptomatic period's upper bound, we estimated that the true
presymptomatic period follows a Gaussian distribution around the mean
(95\% CI: 0.8-3.8). However, this presymptomatic period distribution
implies a non-negligible probability of a negative latent period.
To correct this discrepancy, we assumed a minimum latent period of
.5 days \cite{harcourt2020severe}. Time from symptom onset to death
in critical cases ($\nicefrac{1}{\alpha}$) is estimated using time
from symptom onset to ICU admission in Wang et al \cite{wang2020clinical}.

\subsection{Population structure of demographic-classes derivation (Table \ref{tab:PopParams}
in Main Text)}

In April, 2020, 40.7\% of the population in informal IDP camps in
Northern Syria was aged 0-12, 53.4\% aged 13-50, and 5.9\% aged 51+
\cite{noauthor_syrian_nodate}. To estimate the proportion of each
age group with comorbidities, we calculated the weighted average age-specific
comorbidity prevalence of the 4 most common comorbidities in the Syrian
refugee populations in Jordan and Lebanon: hypertension, cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease \cite{doocy_prevalence_2015,doocy_prevalence_2016}.
We standardized these weighted averages to the age structure of IDPs
in Northern Syria and estimated that 11.7\% of people aged 13-50 have
comorbidities, while 62.9\% of people aged 51+ have comorbidities.

\subsection{Derivation of transmissibility parameters}

The probability of infection if there is a contact between a susceptible
and an infected person depends on the stage of the disease, denoted
$\tau\beta_{\PP}$, $\tau\beta_{\A}$, $\tau\beta_{\I}$ or $\tau\beta_{\HH}$
depending upon whether the infected individual is in the presymptomatic
($P_{i}$), symptomatic ($I_{i}$), asymptomatic ($A_{i}$), or hospitalized
compartment ($H_{i}$), respectively. We estimated these parameters
in two steps. In the following section, we estimate the $\beta_{\X}$
parameters ($\X\in\{\PP,\A,\I,\HH\}$) which represent the relative
transmissibility of each stage with respect to the maximum transmissibility
$\tau$. After this calculation, we present our estimate for the maximum
transmissibility parameter $\tau$.

\subsubsection*{Relative transmissibilities $\beta$ (Table \ref{tab:FixedParams}
in Main Text)}

We start by considering the transmissibility of the presymptomatic
stage as a reference ($\beta_{\PP}=1)$, since the probability of
infection from contact with an individual at this epidemiological
stage is highest \cite{he_temporal_2020}. Next, we set the contribution
of each epidemiological stage to infectivity as proportional to $\beta_{\X}/\gamma_{\X}$,
with $1/\gamma_{\X}$ the duration of stage $\X$. Following He et
al, we estimate the proportion of infectivity that occurs at the presymptomatic
stage ($\X\in\{\PP\}$) as the area under the infectivity curve prior
to symptom onset, $AUC_{\PP}$, and the proportion of infectivity
that occurs at symptomatic stages ($\X\in\{\I,\HH\}$) as the area
under the infectivity curve after symptom onset, $1-AUC_{\PP}$ \cite{he_temporal_2020}:

\begin{equation}
\frac{AUC_{\PP}}{(1-AUC_{\PP})}\approx\frac{\frac{\beta_{\PP}}{\delta_{\PP}}}{\frac{\beta_{\I}}{\gamma_{\I}}+\frac{\beta_{\HH}}{\gamma_{\HH}}}\label{eq:AUC_P}
\end{equation}

We then considered the quantity $\rho_{\HH\I}$, the ratio of the
viral culture positive test rate in hospitalized patients 7-16 days
since start of symptoms to the positive test rate in patients 0-6
days since start of symptoms from van Kampen et al.\cite{van_kampen_shedding_2020}.
Similarly, the relative risk of asymptomatic transmission to symptomatic
transmission according to Byambasuren et al. is expressed as $\rho_{\A\I}$
\cite{byambasuren_estimating_2020}:

\begin{equation}
\beta_{\A}=\beta_{\I}\rho_{\A\I}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\beta_{\HH}=\beta_{\I}\rho_{\HH\I}
\end{equation}

Considering these relationships we rewrite Eq. \ref{eq:AUC_P} to
obtain the desired parameters:

\begin{equation}
\beta_{\I}=\frac{\beta_{\PP}\gamma_{\I}\gamma_{\HH}(1-AUC_{\PP})}{AUC_{\PP}\delta_{\PP}(\gamma_{\HH}+\rho_{\HH\I}\gamma_{\I})}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\beta_{\A}=\frac{\rho_{\A\I}\beta_{\PP}\gamma_{\I}\gamma_{\HH}(1-AUC_{\PP})}{AUC_{\PP}\delta_{\PP}(\gamma_{\HH}+\rho_{\HH\I}\gamma_{\I})}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\beta_{\HH}=\frac{\rho_{\HH\I}\beta_{\PP}\gamma_{\I}\gamma_{\HH}(1-AUC_{\PP})}{AUC_{\PP}\delta_{\PP}(\gamma_{\HH}+\rho_{\HH\I}\gamma_{\I})}.
\end{equation}

The values of $AUC_{\PP}$, $\rho_{\A\I}$ and $\rho_{\HH\I}$ are
presented in Table \ref{tab:TransParams}, and the values of $\beta_{\X}$
in Main Text.

1) Define the infected subsystem, i.e. all equations that include
compartments where individuals can get infected. 2) Linearize the
subsystem in the disease-free equilibrium. 3) Find the next generation
matrix (NGM) with large domain ($K_{L}$) by writing the linear system
as: $\bs{\dot{x}}=(\bs{T}+\bs{\Sigma})\bs{x}$. Here $\bs{x}$ is
a vector containing all states where individuals can get infected,
$\bs{T}$ contains all terms corresponding to transmission and $\bs{\Sigma}$
all terms corresponding to transitions between compartments. Then:
$\bs{K}=-\bs{T}\bs{\Sigma}^{-1}.$ 4) Particularize the solution to
the NGM with small domain ($K_{S}$) and estimate $\tau$ by relating
the dominant eigenvalue of the NGM to an estimation of the basic reproduction
number obtained from the literature.

We also reference the description of R0 in metapopulations in Philipps
S, Rossi D. Mathematical Models of Infectious Diseases: Two-Strain
Infections in Metapopulations, and the methodology for calculating
R0 used by the authors in Gatto M, Bertuzzo E, Mari L, Miccoli S,

\end{comment}

In the following, to simplify the notation we define $\kappa_{i}=(l_{i}\gamma_{\I}+h_{i}\eta+g_{i}\alpha)$.
To estimate the probability of infection if there is a contact between
a susceptible and an infected individual (parameter $\tau$) we proceed
as follows \cite{diekmann_mathematical_2013,philipps_mathematical_2011,gatto_spread_2020}.
We start by considering the subsystem containing the infected population:

\begin{gather}
\dot{E}_{i}=\lambda_{i}S_{i}-\delta_{\EE}E_{i}\\
\dot{P}_{i}=\delta_{\EE}E_{i}-\delta_{\PP}P_{i}\\
\dot{A}_{i}=(1-f)\delta_{\PP}P_{i}-\gamma_{\A}A_{i}\\
\dot{I}_{i}=f\delta_{\PP}P_{i}-\kappa_{i}I_{i}\\
\dot{H}_{i}=h_{i}\eta I_{i}-\gamma_{\HH}H_{i}.
\end{gather}

For the sake of simplifying the notation, let us consider the following
ordering of the variables in the vector $x=(E_{1},...,E_{\M},P_{1},...,P_{\M},A_{1},...,A_{\M},I_{1},...,I_{\M},H_{1},...,H_{\M})$,
with $M$ the number of population classes. We are interested in the
parameterization of the null model, which will serve as a baseline
to estimate the parameter $\tau$, which is initially unknown, but
does not change when interventions are introduced. Considering the
contacts matrix for the null model (Eq. \ref{eq:NullContactsMatrix}
in Main Text), the rate of exposurebecomes

\[
\lambda_{i}=\frac{\tau}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{M}c_{i}\left(\beta_{\PP}P_{j}+\beta_{\A}A_{j}+\beta_{\I}I_{j}+\beta_{\HH}H_{j}\right).
\]

In the following, we use bold symbols for vectors and matrices, and
the symbols $\odot$ and $\oslash$ for the element-wise multiplication
and division, respectively. Following this notation, the linearized
system can be written in the form $\bs{\dot{x}}=(\bs{T}+\bs{\Sigma})\bs{x}$,
where:

\begin{gather}
\bs{T}=\tau\begin{bmatrix}\bs{0} & \bs{\Theta}_{\PP} & \bs{\Theta}_{\A} & \bs{\Theta}_{\I} & \bs{\Theta}_{\HH}\\
\bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0}\\
\bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0}\\
\bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0}\\
\bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}

is the transmission matrix, with $\bs{\Theta}_{\X}=\beta_{\X}\mathrm{diag}(\bs{p}\odot\bs{c})\bs{U}$,
$\bs{p}=\bs{N}/N$, $\bs{U}$ is the all-ones matrix of size $M$,
and $\beta_{\X}$ the infectiousness of compartment $\X$ relative
to the presymptomatic compartment (see Main Text for details). The
transition matrix is

\begin{gather}
\bs{\Sigma}=\begin{bmatrix}-\delta_{\EE}\bs{I} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0}\\
\delta_{\EE}\bs{I} & -\delta_{\PP}\bs{I} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0}\\
\bs{0} & (1-f)\delta_{\PP}\bs{I} & -\gamma_{\A}\bs{I} & \bs{0} & \bs{0}\\
\bs{0} & f\delta_{\PP}\bs{I} & \bs{0} & -\mathrm{diag}(\bs{\kappa})\bs{I} & \bs{0}\\
\bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \eta\mathrm{diag}(\bs{h})\bs{I} & -\gamma_{\HH}\bs{I}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}

Where $\bs{I}$ and $\bs{0}$ are the identity and null matrices of
size $M$, and $\bs{\kappa}=\bs{l}\gamma_{I}+\bs{h}\eta+\bs{g}\alpha$.
We next compute the inverse of the transition matrix

\begin{gather}
\bs{\Sigma^{-1}}=\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{\delta_{\EE}}\bs{I} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0}\\
-\frac{1}{\delta_{\PP}}\bs{I} & -\frac{1}{\delta_{\PP}}\bs{I} & \bs{0} & \bs{0} & \bs{0}\\
-\frac{(1-f)}{\gamma_{\A}}\bs{I} & -\frac{(1-f)}{\gamma_{\A}}\bs{I} & -\frac{1}{\gamma_{\A}}\bs{I} & \bs{0} & \bs{0}\\
-f\mathrm{diag}(\bs{\kappa}^{-1})\bs{I} & -f\mathrm{diag}(\bs{\kappa}^{-1})\bs{I} & \bs{0} & -\mathrm{diag}(\bs{\kappa}^{-1})\bs{I} & \bs{0}\\
-\frac{f\eta}{\gamma_{\HH}}\mathrm{diag}(\bs{h}\oslash\bs{\kappa})\bs{I} & -\frac{f\eta}{\gamma_{\HH}}\mathrm{diag}(\bs{h}\oslash\bs{\kappa})\bs{I} & \bs{0} & -\frac{\eta}{\gamma_{\HH}}\mathrm{diag}(\bs{h}\oslash\bs{\kappa})\bs{I} & -\frac{1}{\gamma_{\HH}}\bs{I}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}

The NGM with large domain can now be found by $\bs{K_{\mathrm{L}}}=-\bs{T}\bs{\Sigma}^{-1}$.
However, since we know that each individual who gets infected becomes
exposed ($E$ compartment), we focus on the NGM with small domain,
${\bf {K_{\mathrm{S}}}}$, which only consists of the $E$ compartment
\cite{heffernan_perspectives_2005}. We do this by removing the rows
that correspond to the other compartments from $T$ and the columns
from $\Sigma^{-1}$ . We then find:

\[
\bs{K_{\mathrm{S}}}=\tau\left[\frac{1}{\delta_{P}}\bs{\Theta}_{\PP}+\frac{(1-f)}{\gamma_{A}}\bs{\Theta}_{\A}+f\mathrm{diag\left(\bs{h}^{-1}\right)\bs{\Theta}_{\I}}+\frac{f\eta}{\gamma_{\HH}}\mathrm{diag}(\bs{h}\oslash\bs{\kappa})\bs{\Theta}_{\HH}\right].
\]

The reproduction number is related to the dominant eigenvalue of $\bs{K_{\mathrm{S}}}$,
i.e. $R_{0}=|\lambda_{1}|$, and $\tau$ is estimated from the dominant
eigenvalue of $\tilde{K}_{\mathrm{S}}=K_{\mathrm{S}}/\tau$. Considering
the null model parameters ($\tilde{\lambda}_{1}^{0}$), we have the
expression:

\begin{equation}
\tau=\frac{R_{0}}{|\tilde{\lambda}_{1}^{0}|}.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Epidemiological severity proportions (Table \ref{tab:TableSeverity}
in Main Text)}

In the Main Text, we presented the proportions in which clinical symptomatic
individuals resolve into critical ($q_{i}^{D}$), severe ($q_{i}^{\HH}$)
and recovered ($q_{i}^{R}$) cases. We assigned the fractions of symptomatic
cases in children aged \textless 13 that would become severe and
critical from the fractions of symptomatic cases in children aged
\textless 11 that were severe and critical in China \cite{dong2020epidemiological}.
We assigned the class-specific fractions of symptomatic cases in adults
that would become severe and critical based on age and comorbidity-specific
fractions of symptomatic cases with known outcomes that required hospitalization,
without and with ICU admission, respectively in the United States
\cite{covid2020preliminary}. To account for poorer health among Syrian
adults compared to their similarly aged peers in developed countries,
estimates for US adults aged 19-64 were used for Syrian adults aged
13-50, while estimates for US adults aged 65+ were used for Syrian
adults aged 51+.

Since the rates at which these individuals progress are different
($\eta$ for $H$, $\alpha$ for $D$ and $\gamma_{\I}$ for $R$)
we introduced three parameters, $h_{i}$, $g_{i}$ and $l_{i}$, to
distribute individuals according to the desired proportions following
the equations:

\begin{equation}
q_{i}^{\HH}=h_{i}\eta\kappa_{i}^{-1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
q_{i}^{D}=g_{i}\alpha\kappa_{i}^{-1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
q_{i}^{R}=1-q_{i}^{\HH}-q_{i}^{D}=l_{i}\gamma_{\I}\kappa_{i}^{-1},
\end{equation}

where $\kappa_{i}=h_{i}\eta+g_{i}\alpha+l_{i}\gamma_{\I}.$ The system
has three unknowns and three equations but one equation linearly depends
on the other two, hence we introduce the constraint $l_{i}=1-h_{i}-g_{i}$
to solve the system as:

\begin{equation}
h_{i}=\frac{\alpha q_{i}^{H}}{\eta q_{i}^{D}}g_{i},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\qquad g_{i}=\gamma_{I}\left(\frac{\alpha}{q_{i}^{D}}+\frac{\gamma_{I}\alpha q_{i}^{H}}{\eta q_{i}^{D}}+\gamma_{I}-\frac{\alpha q_{i}^{H}}{q_{i}^{D}}-\alpha\right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}


\section{Parameterization of the interventions (Table \ref{tab:IntervParams}
in Main Text)}

\subsection{Safety zone}

We considered the existence of a safety zone to protect a certain
fraction, $f_{\mathrm{S}}$, of the population, mostly those more
vulnerable. In practice, this involves dividing the camp in two areas,
a ``green'' zone (denoted $\g$) for the protected population and
an ``orange'' zone ($\oran$) for the exposed population, and dividing
each demographic-class into two behaviour-classes for each respective
zone. These two populations interact via a buffer zone, under controlled
conditions where we assumed transmissivity is reduced by 80\%, encoded
in the parameter $\xi_{ij}=0.2$. Each individual in the green zone
can interact with a limited number ($c_{\family}$) of family members
(hereafter ``visitors'') from the orange zone per day. In some interventions
we considered that individuals visiting the buffer zone will have
a health check (e.g. temperature measurement), aimed at excluding
symptomatic individuals. When the health check is applied, the probability
of transmission by individuals in the $I$ or $H$ compartments from
one zone to susceptible individuals from a different zone is set to
zero (see parameters $\zeta_{\I}$ and $\zeta_{\HH}$ in Eq. \ref{eq:lambdaInterv}
in Main Text). In the following, we derive the values of parameters
$\epsilon_{ij}$ and $\omega_{ij}$, modifying the rate at which individuals
become exposed (see Eq. \ref{eq:lambdaInterv} in Main Text).

Although setting up a safety zone implies a reduction in the number
of contacts between classes of the green zone and the orange zone,
the mean number of contacts that each individual has per day, $c_{i}$,
is conserved. Therefore we need to estimate how contacts will be redistributed
from individuals from a different zone to individuals living in the
same zone. We model this redistribution of contacts with the parameter
$\epsilon_{ij}$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\epsilon_{ij} & = & \vartheta c_{\family}/c_{i}\quad(i,j\textrm{ in different zones})\\
\epsilon_{ij} & = & 1-\vartheta c_{\family}/c_{i}\quad(i,j\textrm{ in same zone}).
\end{eqnarray*}

We define $\vartheta$ as\footnote{If $c_{\family}$ is large enough ( $c_{\family}\approx$ 15 contacts
per day), $\vartheta$ should saturate, because every member of the
orange zone would eventually visit the buffer zone, following the
expression:

\[
\vartheta=\begin{cases}
1 & \textrm{if }i\in\g\\
f_{\oran,\family}\left(1-\varTheta(f_{\oran,\family}-1)\frac{f_{\oran,\family}-1}{f_{\oran,\family}}\right) & \textrm{if }i\in\oran
\end{cases}
\]

with the Heaviside function $\varTheta(f_{\oran,\family}-1)=1$ if
$f_{\oran,\family}\geq1$. We chose values well below this saturation
threshold (a maximum of 10 contacts per week, i.e. 1.42 contacts per
day).}:

\[
\vartheta=\begin{cases}
1 & \textrm{if }i\in\g\\
f_{\oran,\family} & \textrm{if }i\in\oran
\end{cases}
\]

If we assume that visitors are always different, the quantity $f_{\oran,\family}=c_{\family}\frac{N_{\g}}{N_{\oran}}$
is the fraction of the orange population that visits the buffer zone.

Next, we estimate how  the probability of interaction between a member
of class $i$ and class $j$ is modified with respect to the null
model, depending on the zones from which class $i$ and class $j$
are drawn. Suppose classes $i$ and $j$ are separated from the rest
of the population and confined within a restricted zone. The probability
that an individual of class $i$ randomly encounters an individual
of class $j$ is larger in the restricted zone than in the previous
setting, in which both classes had access to the whole camp mixed
with individuals belonging to other classes. %
\begin{comment}
I've found the explanation a little bit too abstract, hence open to
misinterpretations
\end{comment}
{} This modification of relative probability of interaction is encoded
in the parameter $\omega_{ij}$ (see Eq. \ref{eq:lambdaInterv} in
Main Text). More specifically, the proportion $N_{i}/N$ of individuals
of class $i$ in the null model becomes $N_{i}/N_{\X}$ with $N_{\X}$
the total number of individuals in zone $X=\{\oran,\g\}$. This yields
the following values for $\omega_{ij}$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\omega_{ij} & = & \nicefrac{\left(\frac{N_{i}}{N_{\X}}\right)}{\left(\frac{N}{N_{i}}\right)}=\frac{N}{N_{\X}}\quad(i,j\textrm{ in same zone}\ X)\\
\omega_{ij} & = & \nicefrac{\left(\frac{N_{i}}{N_{\Y}}\right)}{\left(\frac{N}{N_{i}}\right)}=\frac{N}{N_{\Y}}\quad(i\in X\textrm{ and}\ j\in Y).
\end{eqnarray*}

\caption{\label{tab:SafetyScenarios}\textbf{Fraction of population in each
zone by safety zone scenario and behaviour-class. }Behaviour-classes
that are not considered in a given scenario have a proportion equal
to zero.}
\end{table}

Following this parameterization, we explore different scenarios, summarized
in Table \ref{tab:SafetyScenarios}, for allocating members of each
population class to the safety, or ``green'' zone, and the exposed,
or ``orange'' zone. In one scenario, we only place individuals in
age group 3 (\textgreater 50) in the green zone, while in another
we place all vulnerable individuals, age group 3 and age group 2 (13-50)
with comorbidities, in the green zone. In 3 additional scenarios,
after all vulnerable individuals are allocated to the green zone,
we set the green zone's capacity to a certain percentage of the camp's
population (20\%, 25\%, 30\%), and allocate its remainder to non-vulnerable
family members, who by necessity are either children \textless 13
in age group 1 or healthy younger adults in age group 2. In accordance
with camp managers' expectations that many vulnerable individuals
will have non-vulnerable spouses, while fewer vulnerable individuals
will have young children, in these scenarios we allocate 40\% of the
remainder of the green zone to children and 60\% of the remainder
of the green zone to younger adults without comorbidities. We also
consider a baseline scenario in which there is no green zone.

\subsection{Self-isolation and evacuation}

To implement self-isolation we start expanding our model (Eqs \ref{eq:System1}--\ref{eq:System8}
in Main Text) to consider a new compartment for each demographic-class.
We split the clinical symptomatic compartment to model the fact that
symptomatic individuals require some time to recognize their symptoms
and to self-isolate. To model this, whenever simulating the isolation
intervention, the symptomatic compartment is split in two compartments:
symptomatic prior to identification, $O_{i}$, and symptomatic following
identification, $I_{i}$. Following these considerations, the structure
of the model is represented in Fig. \ref{fig:DiagramOnset}, which
obey the following equations:

The second modification required is a distinction between the isolated
and non-isolated population within the clinical symptomatic compartment
after identification of symptoms ($I_{i}$). This distinction should
be made for each class except for the youngest population (age 1)
for which do not consider realistic their self-isolation. The split
in these two subpopulations is implemented computing, at each integration
step in the simulation, the number of total infected individuals,
$N_{\I}=\sum_{i}I_{i}$. Next, we consider the isolation capacity
of the camp ($\tilde{N}$), and we assumed that the number of isolated
individuals for each class is proportional to the number of clinical
symptomatic individuals in the class, i.e. $\tilde{I}_{i}=\tilde{N}I_{i}/N_{\I}$.
Note that, in doing this, we are not creating compartments, we are
simply identifying the number of individuals that this class has under
isolation. Once their numbers are determined, we just need to focus
on the fact that the two subpopulations (isolated and not isolated)
have a different number of contacts and exposure to the other classes,
which can be implemented in $\lambda_{i}$.

Therefore, we just need to proceed by estimating the parameterization
of $\lambda_{i}$ following the intervention, in particular the values
of $\epsilon_{ij}$ and $\omega_{ij}$ (see Eq \ref{eq:lambdaInterv}
in Main Text). Firstly, we consider that individuals in the onset
compartment are equally infectious than those clinical symptomatic
individuals not isolated (i.e. the relative transmissibility is $\beta_{\I}$).
Secondly, we consider how the different classes interact with isolated
and not-isolated individuals. The younger healthy adults class requires
a more specific derivation, since it is the only class interacting
with isolated individuals, and we should make a number of assumptions
on how the interactions betweeen them take place. 

We considered a number $N_{\textrm{care}}$ of carers having $c_{\care}$
contacts per day with the isolated population. As we anticipated,
carers are entirely drawn from younger adults (age 2) with no comorbidities,
and must have no symptoms. We denote the number of individuals fulfilling
these requirements with $N_{\Exp}$ (number of exposed), which varies
along the simulation. When the total number of symptomatic individuals,
$N_{\I}$, exceeds the isolation capacity, $\tilde{N},$ the individuals
in excess are fully infectious. .  Finally, symptomatic individuals
that would require hospitalization, are either evacuated and are no
longer infectious, or become fully infectious. The rationale behind
the latter choice is that camps lack the necessary means to adequately
protect the rest of the population when individuals require more dedicated
care. In particular, it is unlikely that a severely ill individual
would be able to stay alone in a tent. We model evacuation considering
a parameter $\zeta_{\HH}=0$ if evacuation is put in place and $\zeta_{\HH}=1$
otherwise.

Given these assumptions, to estimate the rate of exposure for each
demographic-class we split our expression of contacts into two terms,
one describing the interaction of individuals in the class with the
isolated population, and another for interaction with infectious individuals
who are not isolated:

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{i}=\tau\sum_{j}\underset{\mathrm{isolated}}{\underbrace{\beta_{\I}\tilde{c}_{i}\tilde{P}(i\rightarrow j)}}+\underset{\mathrm{not\ isolated}}{\underbrace{C_{ij}\frac{\beta_{\PP}P+\beta_{\A}A_{j}+\beta_{\I}O_{i}+\beta_{\I}\varTheta(N_{\I}-\tilde{N})(I_{j}-\tilde{I}_{j})+\zeta_{\HH}\beta_{\HH}H_{j}}{N_{j}}}},
\end{equation}

where $\tilde{c}_{i}$ is the mean number of contacts of class $i$
per individual per day with the self-isolated individuals and $\tilde{P}(i\rightarrow j)$
is the probability that an individual of class $i$ encounters an
isolated individual of class $j$. For the not-isolated term, we maintain
the well-mixed population assumption explained in the Main Text, with
the incorporation of a Heaviside function, $\varTheta(N_{\I}-\tilde{N})$,
which activates the interaction with the clinical symptomatic individuals
when their number $N_{\I}$ exceeds the isolation capacity $\tilde{N}$,
and we estimate the probability of interacting with non-isolated individuals
to be proportional to their fraction $(I_{j}-\tilde{I}_{j})/N_{j}$.
For the isolated population, however, the well-mixed assumption is
no longer valid. Firstly, all demographic-classes not contributing
to the group of carers will never interact with the isolated individuals,
and hence $\tilde{c}_{i}=0$ for them (morever $\tilde{P}(i\rightarrow j)=0$).
Secondly, the healthy younger adults population will certainly interact
with isolated individuals through their role as carers, hence $\tilde{P}(i\rightarrow j)=1$.

To estimate $\tilde{c}_{i}$ for the healthy younger adult class,
we note that the number of contacts per day with the isolated individuals
is $c_{\care}N_{\care}$, and hence the mean number of contacts per
individuals per day is $\tilde{c}_{i}=c_{\care}N_{\care}/N_{\Exp}$.
We observe that, increasing the number of carers, and the number of
contacts per day between carers and individuals, will increase the
rate of infection. This problem could be circumvented considering
a group of carers with a fixed number of individuals. However, it
is also expected that the size of this group should increase if the
number of isolated individuals increases, and additional assumptions
should be put in place. For simplicity, we assume that there is one
carer from the the healthy younger adult demographic-class (indexed
$k$) for each infected person in the class $j,$ (i.e. $N_{\care,j}=\tilde{I}_{j}$),
having only one contact per day ($c_{\care}=1$). Note the convenience
of this choice, since the number of carers will linearly increase
with the number of isolated individuals (if there is enough capacity),
what will allow us to investigate potential shortcomings of the intervention
when the burden of symptomatic individuals is large, and the number
of carers increases in tandem. In addition, since the number of individuals
available from the young healthy adult population, $N_{\Exp}$, will
also change during the simulations (in particular it will be suffer
a reduction during the time interval in which infections spread),
considering this expression we may reach a situation in which the
number of symptomatic individuals is larger than the number of potential
carers, i.e.the ratio $\tilde{N}/N_{\Exp}>1$, which can be naturally
interpreted saying that each carer will need more than one contact
per day  to take care of the isolated population.

With these considerations, we can express the rate of exposure of
the healthy younger adult demographic-class (indexed $k$) as:

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{k}=\tau\sum_{j}\underset{\textrm{isolated}}{\underbrace{\xi c_{\care}\frac{\tilde{I}_{j}}{N_{\Exp}}}}+\underset{\textrm{not isolated}}{\underbrace{\left(c_{i}-c_{\care}\frac{\tilde{I}_{j}}{N_{\Exp}}\right)\left(\frac{N_{j}-\tilde{I}_{j}}{N}\right)\left(\frac{\beta_{\PP}P+\beta_{\A}A_{j}+\beta_{\I}\varTheta(N_{\I}-\tilde{N})(I_{j}-\tilde{I}_{j})+\zeta_{\HH}\beta_{\HH}H_{j}}{N_{j}-\tilde{I}_{j}}\right)}}.
\end{equation}

We can express this equation following the parameterization presented
in Eq. \ref{ROTO: Ref: eq:lambdaInterv} in Main Text by choosing
$\epsilon_{ij}=(c_{\care}/c_{i})(\tilde{I}_{j}/N_{\Exp})$ and $\omega_{ij}=N/N_{j}$
for the isolated population, and $\epsilon_{ij}=1-(c_{\care}/c_{i})(\tilde{I}_{j}/N_{\Exp})$,
$\omega_{ij}=1$ for the interaction with the population not isolated.For
the remaining classes ($i\neq k$) the rate of infection (\ref{eq:lambda1})
becomes:

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{i}=\tau\sum_{j}\underset{\textrm{not isolated}}{\underbrace{c_{i}\left(\frac{N_{j}-\tilde{I}_{j}}{N}\right)\frac{\beta_{\PP}P+\beta_{\A}A_{j}+\beta_{\I}\varTheta(N_{\I}-\tilde{N})(I_{j}-\tilde{I}_{j})+\zeta_{\HH}\beta_{\HH}H_{j}}{N_{j}-\tilde{I}_{j}}}},
\end{equation}

which does not require further parameterization ($\text{\ensuremath{\epsilon_{ij}=1} and \ensuremath{\omega_{ij}=1}}).$

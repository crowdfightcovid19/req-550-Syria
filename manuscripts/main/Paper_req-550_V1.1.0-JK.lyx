\begin_layout Abstract
More than 1 billion people live in informal settlements worldwide, where
 precarious living conditions pose unique challenges to managing a COVID-19
 outbreak.
 Taking Northwest Syria as a case-study, we simulated an outbreak in high-densit
y informal Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps using a stochastic Susceptib
le-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model.
 Expanding on previous studies, taking social conditions and population
 health/structure into account, we modeled several interventions feasible
 in these settings: moderate self-distancing, self-isolation of symptomatic
 cases, and protection of the most vulnerable in “safety zones”.
 We considered complementary measures to these interventions that can be
 implemented autonomously by these communities, such as buffer zones, daily
 health-checks, and carers for isolated individuals, quantifying their impact
 on the micro-dynamics of disease transmission.
 All interventions significantly reduce outbreak probability and

 when an outbreak does occur

.
 Self-distancing reduces mortality by up to 35% if contacts are reduced
 by 50%.
 A similar reduction in

mortality

\change_inserted 227091064 1615573165
mortality 
\change_unchanged
can be achieved by providing 1 self-isolation tent per 200 people.
 Protecting the most vulnerable in a safety zone 
\change_inserted 227091064 1615577660
both reduces mortality among them and 
\change_unchanged
has synergistic effects with the other interventions
\change_deleted 227091064 1615577669
 and reduces mortality in the most vulnerable population
\change_unchanged
.
 Our model predicts that a combination of all simulated interventions may
 reduce mortality by as much as 80% and delay an outbreak’s peak by

 Our results highlight the potential for non-medical interventions to mitigate
 the effects of the pandemic.
 Similar measures may be applicable to controlling COVID-19 in other informal
 settlements, particularly IDP camps in conflict regions, around the world.

Key questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
What is already known?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have provided evidence
 for the effectiveness of strategies such as social distancing, testing,
 contact tracing, case isolation, use of personal protective equipment/facemasks
 and improved hygiene to reduce the spread of the disease.
 These studies underlie the recommendations of the World Health Organisation,
 but their implementation is contingent on local conditions and resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mathematical modelling is the basis of many epidemiological studies and
 has helped inform policymakers considering COVID-19 responses around the
 world.
 Nevertheless, only a limited number of studies have applied these models
 to informal settlements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
What are the new findings?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We developed a mathematical model to study the dynamics of COVID-19 in Syrian
 IDP camps, elaborating on previous efforts done in similar settings by
 explicitly paramet
\change_inserted 227091064 1613579866
e
\change_unchanged
rizing the camps’ demographics, living conditions and micro-dynamics of
 interpersonal contacts in our modelization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We designed interventions such as self-distancing, self-isolation and the
 creation of safety zones to protect the most vulnerable members of the
 population, among others, through conversations with camp managers with
 on-the-ground knowledge of what interventions would be feasible and have
 community buy-in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Our results show how low-cost, feasible, community-led non-medical interventions
 can significantly mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in Northwest Syrian IDP
 camps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
What do the new findings imply?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Our model represents a step forward in the much-needed search for epidemiologica
l models that are sufficiently flexible to consider specific social questions.
 The model can also help inform similar interventions in refugee camps in
 conflict-torn regions, and potentially be adapted to other informal settlements
 and vulnerable communities around the world.

This study focuses on the Northwest region of Syria (NWS): a relatively
 small geographical area with 4.2 million people, of which 1.15 million (27.4%)
 are IDPs living in camps

, and where the number of cases increased twenty-fold between September
 8th and October 20th, 2020 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UNOCHA_collapse"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The health status of households in camps in NWS is poor; 24% have a member
 with a chronic disease, of whom 41% have no access to medicines 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "noauthor_syria_nodate"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As in other conflict regions, the political instability in NWS hinders
 coordinated public health actions, and the ongoing movements of IDPs create
 ample opportunity for infectious disease transmission, while making contact
 tracing interventions infeasible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate feasible COVID-19 prevention interventions in the camps,
 we considered a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model similar
 to the one presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gatto_spread_2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, in which the camps' populations are divided into classes reflecting their
 estimated age-structures and comorbidity prevalence.
 We use this model to propose various interventions aimed at reducing the
 number of contacts within and between population classes in general, and
 with symptomatic individuals in particular.
 We paid special attention to how the living conditions in informal camps
 inform the assumptions underlying our proposed interventions, a question
 often neglected 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rhodes_Model2context_2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We modeled interventions previously proposed for African cities 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vanzandvoort2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, such as self-distancing, isolation of symptomatic individuals and the
 creation of a 'safety zone' in which more vulnerable members of the population
 are protected from exposure to the virus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Building upon the approach used to model the impact of these interventions
 in African cities, our model includes a parameterization of the contacts
 each individual has per day 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vanzandvoort2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We further elaborate upon this approach by making a more explicit representatio
n of contacts and other parameters in the model.
 We consider the micro-dynamics of contacts, the time that individuals take
 to recognize their symptoms before self-isolating, the effect of having
 carers to attend to isolated individuals, and the existence of a buffer
 zone in which exposed and protected population classes can interact under
 certain rules.
 We examine a potential worst-case scenario in which there is no access
 to any healthcare facility.
 Since empowering local communities in conflict regions to understand how
 to control COVID-19 is possibly the most (and perhaps only) effective way
 to minimize its spread, our models are of utmost importance for informing
 the implementation of realistic interventions in these regions.

).
 The model is adapted to the context of NWS IDP camps and is divided into
 compartments containing individuals at different possible stages along
 the disease's progression, governed by the following set of differential
 equations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather}
\dot{S}_{i}=-\lambda_{i}S_{i}\label{eq:System1}\\
\dot{E}_{i}=\lambda_{i}S_{i}-\delta_{\EE}E_{i}\\
\dot{P}_{i}=\delta_{\EE}E_{i}-\delta_{\PP}P_{i}\\
\dot{A}_{i}=(1-f)\delta_{\PP}P_{i}-\gamma_{\A}A_{i}\\
\dot{I}_{i}=f\delta_{\PP}P_{i}-(l_{i}\gamma_{I}+h_{i}\eta+g_{i}\alpha)I_{i}\\
\dot{H}_{i}=h_{i}\eta I_{i}-\gamma_{\HH}H_{i}\\
\dot{R}_{i}=\gamma_{\A}A_{i}+l_{i}\gamma_{\I}I_{i}+(1-\sigma)\gamma_{\HH}H_{i}\\
\dot{D_{i}}=g_{i}\alpha I_{i}+\sigma\gamma_{\HH}H_{i}\label{eq:System8}
\end{gather}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The susceptible population (
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}$
\end_inset

) becomes exposed at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

, while exposed individuals (
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}$
\end_inset

) progress through the latent period at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{\EE}$
\end_inset

 to a preclinical infectious stage (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}$
\end_inset

), which then progresses to (at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{\PP}$
\end_inset

) either a a clinical (symptomatic, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

, with probablity 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

) or subclinical (asymptomatic, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}$
\end_inset

, with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-f$
\end_inset

) infectious stage.
 Asymptomatic cases recover (
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$
\end_inset

) at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\A}$
\end_inset

.
 Symptomatic cases have 3 potential outcomes: mild cases will recover at
 rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\I}$
\end_inset

, severe cases will progress to an extended infectious period during which
 they require hospitalization (
\begin_inset Formula $H_{i}$
\end_inset

) at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, while critical cases requiring ICU care will die (
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i}$
\end_inset

) at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, since the fate of individuals in the hospitalized compartment
 is uncertain if healthcare is not available, we run simulations considering
 two possibilities: either all recover (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0$
\end_inset

), or all die (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=1$
\end_inset

) (see section Epidemiological severity assumptions).

Diagram of the model.
 
\series default
The model considers the following compartments: susceptible (S), exposed
 (E), infectious-presymptomatic (P), infectious-asymptomatic (A), infectious-sym
ptomatic (I), infectious-requiring hospitalization (H), recovered (R) and
 dead (D).

Demographic– and behaviour-classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model splits the population into classes (indexed 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

) to account for heterogeneity with respect to clinical risk and behaviour.
 Working with population classes allows us to encode behavioural assumptions
 in the model and strike an appropriate balance between generality, computationa
l tractability, and the requisite specificity to realistically evaluate
 our proposed interventions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "funk_BehaviourInModels_2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, the explicit representation of contacts between and within population
 classes allows us to design interventions considering cultural and context-spec
ific assumptions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rhodes_Model2context_2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (see section Interventions and Supplementary Material for details).
 Under a null model where no interventions are implemented, the distinctions
 between classes are only dependent on age and comorbidity status (hereafter

\end_inset

).
 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{i}$
\end_inset

 are demographic-class specific parameters, adjusted to ensure that the
 proportions of symptomatic cases progressing through each of the 3 potential
 clinical outcomes (mild, severe, and critical) are consistent with the
 literature (see section Epidemiological severity assumptions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under some interventions, the demographic-classes may be subdivided further
 into subclasses according to behaviour (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

behaviour-classes

\end_inset

).
 Consequently, different interventions may require models with different
 numbers of classes.
 We refer to both demographic- and behaviour-classes generically as

 The population sizes of informal camps are approximately log-normally distribut
ed, with a mean of of 1212.
 We simulated camps with populations of 500, 1000 and 2000 individuals.
 Since interventions tend to be less effective in larger camps, the results
 presented refer to simulations with 2000 individuals, unless otherwise
 specified.
 For our demographic-classes, we considered 3 age groups: children (age
 1, 0-12 years old), younger adults (age 2, 13-50 yrs) and older adults
 (age 3, >50 yrs).
 For ages 2 and 3, we considered two subclasses comprising healthy individuals
 and individuals with comorbidities (see Table

Transmissibility assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although individuals in IDP camps share tents with other co-occupants, whom
 they may be more likely to infect than occupants of different tents, we
 ignore spatial structure in our model and assume a well-mixed population.
 This is justified because individuals from different tents share common
 spaces (e.g.
 letrines) and have frequent interactions with each other, especially among
 children.
 Consequently, our following derivation of the transmissivity parameter
 itself, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, is not spatially explicit.

 is the average number of contacts that individuals of class 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 have with individuals of class 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 per day and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the total population size of class 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 We parameterized 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{ij}$
\end_inset

 by multiplying the mean number of total contacts that individuals from
 a population class 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 have per day, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

, by the probability of random interaction with individuals of class 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 Considering a well-mixed population, this probability is proportional to
 class 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

's fraction of the total population, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{ij}=c_{i}N_{j}/N$
\end_inset

.
 If interventions are absent, we consider demographic-classes only and,
 hence, different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 reflect heterogeneity in the number of contacts by age group.
 We assume specific values of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 for each class based on conversations with camp managers in NWS (see Table

 Although we do not have access to official data on healthcare occupancy,
 the currently reported number of cases suggests that this scenario could
 already have been reached 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Hence, we considered a worst-case scenario in which individuals will not
 have access to healthcare and assumed that all critical cases (those requiring
 ICU care) would die.
 However, there is greater uncertainty about the fate of severe cases, those
 requiring hospitalization but not ICU care.
 We therefore considered a compartment for severe cases to account for a
 longer infectious period if they stay in the camp (see compartment

\end_inset

, Fig.

).
 This compartment also helped us model some interventions more realistically,
 for example by noting that the symptoms of severe cases are incompatible
 with self-isolation.
 To estimate upper and lower bounds for the outcome variables of our model,
 we simulated two possible scenarios for the fate of this compartment: one
 in which all cases recover, and another in which all die.
 In the simulations presented in the Main Text, we consider the worst-case
 scenario in which all of these cases die.

\series bold
Proportion of symptomatic cases that become severe and critical.

\series default
 Since the rates at which these cases become severe, critical, or recover
 are different, we introduced three paramaters (
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{i}$
\end_inset

) to distribute individuals according to the desired proportions (values
 between parenthesis).
 The proportion of individuals recovering is computed as 
\begin_inset Formula $1-q_{i}^{\HH}-q_{i}^{\DD}$
\end_inset

 (see Supplementary Materials for details).

\begin_layout Subsection*
Interventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interventions we consider are modelled by modifying the rate at which
 individuals become exposed (the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

, Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lambda"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), adding new population classes that govern behavioural changes (behaviour-clas
ses), and/or adding a compartment to consider the time until detection of
 symptoms (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "BROKEN: Ref: fig:DiagramOnset"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be factorized in four terms, the interventions may influence one or
 several of these terms.
 The factors present in 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 and the terms modulating them in the interventions are (see Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lambdaInterv"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

): i) the maximum transmissibility, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, which is reduced in some interventions by a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{ij}$
\end_inset

, when interactions are restricted to buffer zones (see below for details);
 ii) the average number of contacts that individuals in class 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 have per day, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This quantity can either be uniformly reduced across all classes, or the
 contact rate of class 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 with class 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 can be modified.
 We model this modification of contact rates using the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{ij}$
\end_inset

; iii) the probability of encounter between members of class 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 in a well-mixed population, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{j}/N$
\end_inset

.
 This probability can vary by modifying the visibility of a member of class
 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 to a member of class 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 , which we express with the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{ij}$
\end_inset

; and iv) the probablility of becoming infected by individuals at specific
 stages of the disease (e.g.
 for hospitalized individuals this is encoded in the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{\HH}H_{j}/N_{j}$
\end_inset

) can also be modified by specific factors.
 Only the terms for individuals at the clinical symptomatic (
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

) and hospitalized (
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

) stages are modified in our interventions, through the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{\I}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{\HH}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 Following these considerations, the generic form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 under the interventions becomes:

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Self-distancing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first non-medical intervention that we modeled is a reduction in the
 mean number of contacts per individual per day for the whole camp population
 (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Interventions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

-1).
 The average number of contacts of each class 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:PopParams"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) is reduced by a class-independent factor, hence the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is uniform for all classes, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{ij}=\epsilon,\quad\epsilon\in\{0.9,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.5\}$
\end_inset

.
 No further adjustments are required for this intervention.
 Since the mean number of inhabitants per tent in a camp is 5.5 and sanitation
 facilities are shared 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "noauthor_syrian_nodate"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we inferred that the number of contacts per day cannot be reduced by more
 than 50% (
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0.5$
\end_inset

).
 For a younger adult, this would mean 7.5 contacts per day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Self-isolation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Self-isolation is a challenge in informal settlements, where households
 consist of a single (often small) space, water is collected at designated
 locations, sanitation facilities are communal and food supplies are scarce.
 We considered the possibility of those showing symptoms (i.e.
 in compartment 
\begin_inset Formula $\I$
\end_inset

) self-isolating in individual tents in dedicated parts of the camps.
 We excluded individuals with severe symptoms (
\begin_inset Formula $\HH$
\end_inset

 compartment) from the intervention since they require additional care not
 compatible with self-isolation.
 Instead, we considered the possibility of evacuating these individuals
 from the camp as an additional intervention (see below).
 We simulated self-isolation with various numbers of isolation tents per
 camp, ranging from 10 to 2000 for a camp of 2000 people (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Interventions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

-2).
 In addition, we modeled the role of carers dedicated to providing for isolated
 individuals (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Interventions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

-2a).
 Carers are drawn from the younger adults class with no comorbidities who
 are not at a stage of the disease during which they display symptoms (i.e.
 not in compartments 
\begin_inset Formula $\I$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\HH$
\end_inset

), while isolated individuals may belong to any class
\change_inserted 227091064 1615577832
.

\change_unchanged
 Since this intervention only modifies the infectiousness of individuals
 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\I$
\end_inset

 compartment and the exposure of carers, the consideration of additional
 behavioural-classes is not required.
 Instead, the intervention can be encoded in 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 by simply splitting the contribution of symptomatic individuals to the
 rate of exposure into two terms, one for the isolated individuals and another
 for the remaining population.
 Hence, its implementation requires deriving the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{ij}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{ij}$
\end_inset

 for interaction between healthy younger adults (from which carers are drawn),
 the remaining classes, and isolated and non-isolated individuals separately.
 In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:IntervParams"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we present these terms and their derivation in Supplementary Materials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, interactions between carers and isolated individuals were restricte
d to 
\shape italic
buffer zones
\shape default
, which we envisioned as open spaces, with guidelines in place to limit
 occupancy to 4 individuals wearing masks with at least 2 meters of distance
 between them, where we assume transmissivity is reduced by 80% (
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{ij}=0.2$
\end_inset

).
 In considering one carer per isolated individual with one contact per day,
 we do not neglect their probability of infecting the rest of the camp.
 We also considered minimum time intervals for individuals to recognize
 their symptoms: with means of 12, 24 and 48 hours (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Interventions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

-2b), which was implemented by incorporating an additional compartment (
\begin_inset Formula $O_{i}$
\end_inset

) between the presymptomatic 
\begin_inset Formula $(P_{i}$
\end_inset

) and clinical symptomatic (
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

) compartments (see Suppl.
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DiagramOnset"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Safety zone
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this intervention, the camp is divided in two areas: a safety zone, in
 which more vulnerable people live (hereby referred to as a “green” zone
 following previous studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vanzandvoort2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), and an exposed (“orange”) zone with the remaining population.
 In our simulations, the first exposed individual always belongs to the
 orange zone.
 The living conditions within both zones remain the same, so the overall
 contact rate does not change unless self-distancing is also implemented.
 A consequence of maintaining the overall contact rate is that, reducing
 contacts with individuals living in a different zone, implies an increase
 in contacts with individuals in the same zone (see Supplementary Material).
 Although we do not expect this assumption to be true in general, it allows
 us to investigate undesired side-effects of this intervention, such as
 older adults having increased contacts amongst themselves if isolated together.
 Since proposals for partitioning the population may be received differently
 across camps, we considered several scenarios for allocating a camp population
 to the two zones (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Interventions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

-3).
 Implementing this intervention thus requires the split of some demographic-clas
ses into two behaviour-classes, depending upon the scenario.
 For example, if some healthy younger adults are allocated into the green
 zone, we split the demographic-class 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

healthy younger adults
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

orange
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

green
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 behaviour-classes, to model the different contact rates that these two
 subclasses of healthy younger adults will have amongst themselves and with
 other classes.
 In Supplementary Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:SafetyScenarios"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we present the classes considered in each scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interactions between the two zones are limited to a buffer zone, reducing
 transmissivity (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{ij}=0.2$
\end_inset

, see previous section).
 Individuals in the green zone cannot leave and thus need to be provided
 with supplies by individuals in the orange zone, which will take place
 in the buffer zone.
 In our simulations, we considered limiting individuals in the green zone
 to 10 or 2 contacts with individuals from the orange zone per week (see
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Interventions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

-3a).
 Other variations of this intervention we explored include preventing symptomati
c individuals from entering the buffer zone (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Interventions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

-3b) and a “lockdown” of the green zone, where the number of weekly contacts
 in the buffer zone is reduced by 50% or 90% (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Interventions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

-3c).
 Although overall contact rates are conserved in this intervention, we modify
 the contact rates between 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{ij}$
\end_inset

 and the probability of interaction between 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{ij}$
\end_inset

, where both parameters are determined by whether 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 are in the same or different zones (see Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:IntervParams"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for specific values).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Evacuation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last intervention we simulated is the evacuation of severe cases (individual
s in the hospitalization compartment).
 Since they require more intensive care that cannot be delivered while adhering
 to the guidelines of a buffer zone, severe cases were assumed to be fully
 infectious and not able to self-isolate.
 Once severe cases are evacuated, their infectivity is reduced to zero (
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{\HH}=0$
\end_inset

, see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Interventions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

-4).
 The fate of severe cases is not altered by this intervention since we assumed
 that hospitals are saturated and that evacuees are transferred to isolation
 centers instead.

\change_unchanged
Our simulations start with a completely susceptible population where one
 person in the younger adult population is exposed to the virus (who is
 also in the orange zone if the safety zone intervention is in place).
 We verified that a steady state was always reached before the end of each
 simulation.
 We did not consider migration, births, nor deaths due to other causes,
 since they are small enough in magnitude to not significantly impact the
 course of an outbreak, provided additional conflict does not erupt.

 simulations and compared results between them.
 The main variables considered are the fraction of simulations in which
 at least one death is observed, a proxy for the probability of an outbreak,
 the fraction of the population that dies and the time until the symptomatic
 population peaks, as well as the infection fatality rate (IFR), the fractions
 of the population that are recovered and remain susceptible at steady-state.
 For consistency, we only considered simulations in which there was an outbreak
 when comparing the outcome of a variable between interventions.

 A near-quadratic trend is observed for the fraction of population dying,

 Self-distancing also significantly extends the time until the peak of the

 The proportion of the population escaping from infection after 12 months
 also increases up to near 33% when a 50% reduction is considered, and the
 proportion of the population recovered after 12 months (which may help
 with population level protection against future outbreaks) is reduced from
 84% to 60% (see Supplementary Fig.

With only 10 tents for a camp of 2000 people (i.e.

 Importantly, the potential reductions in probability of outbreak, overall
 fatalities and IFR from self-isolation are realized whether the time required
 for individuals to recognize their symptoms is 12h or 24h on average, but
 the intervention becomes less effective when this time increases to 48h
 (see Supplementary Fig.

Safety zone
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we consider the scenario in which all older adults, younger
 adults with comorbidities and their family members up to 20% of the camp
 population live in the green zone, unless otherwise specified.
 Creating a green zone improves the effect of the previous interventions
 overall, but with sometimes opposite outcomes in the exposed and protected
 populations.
 For example, the probability of an outbreak decreases for the protected
 population, by around 11%, if only two contacts are allowed per week in
 the buffer zone (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Panel2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

G).
 Notably, most of this reduction is only achieved when health-checks excluding
 symptomatic individuals from the buffer zone are in place (see Supplementary
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Suppl_Tcheck"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the effect of removing health-checks).
 On the other hand, the probability of an outbreak may slightly increase
 for the exposed population, a consequence of the relative increase in intra-zon
e contacts.
 By shifting the burden of an outbreak towards the less vulnerable population
 in the orange zone, another important outcome of this intervention is the
 notable increase in time (~62%)
\change_inserted 227091064 1615574246
 
\change_unchanged
until the number of symptomatic cases peaks for the vulnerable population,
 and a 40% increase in time for the whole population(see Fig.

I).
 Nevertheless, this intervention 
\change_inserted 227091064 1615574275

has a modest reduction on overall mortality (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Considering different scenarios for allocating people to the green zone,
 the lowest probability of an outbreak is achieved when only older adults

The incorporation of a lockdown has the greatest effect on reducing the
 probability of an outbreak in the green zone, to under 0.25 when contacts
 in the buffer zone are reduced by 90%.
 While lockdowns show no positive effect on green zone fatalities in the
 few instances where an outbreak does reach there, they decrease 
\change_inserted 227091064 1615574873

Evacuation

We observe no significant effects when severe cases requiring hospitalization
 are evacuated (see Supplementary Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Suppl_evacuation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Since we considered that these individuals will not receive health care
 (they are evacuated to isolation centers), their fate remains the same
 than if staying in the camp and, hence, we expect evacuation to have an
 effect only in reducing the infectivity.
 Although these individuals spend a longer period being infectious with
 respect to an individual having mild symptoms (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

10 days longer), the number of individuals under these conditions is only
 a small fraction of the total infectious population at any given time,
 what explains why we do not observe significant effects for this intervention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Combined interventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of the interventions observed when we examine them individually
 build upon each other when multiple interventions are implemented in tandem

 and Supplementary Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The protective effects of the safety zone intervention especially are most
 fully realized not when implemented on its own, but when paired with other
 interventions.
 They become so effective that outbreaks in the green zone become exceptionally
 rare, but so well controlled when they do happen, that the majority of
 outbreaks are small enough for us to observe an anomalous increase in IFR
 in some of the most effective interventions, driven by the discretization
 of the values it can take (Supplementary Table.

 When all interventions are implemented together: strict self-distancing
 (50% reduction in contacts), self-isolation of symptomatic cases (1 tent
 for every 40 people), a safety zone with 2 contacts per week in the buffer
 zone, health checks, a strict lockdown (90%), and evacuation of severe
 cases, mortality is reduced by

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we propose a number of interventions of immediate applicability
 to informal settlements.
 We focused on IDP settlements in NW Syria, taking into account the intervention
s' feasibility, cultural acceptance and their need for low-cost.
 When confronted with different possible scenarios, we generally considered
 the worst-cases, highlighting the interventions that are most effective
 in the direst conditions, but possibly resulting in an overestimate of
 mortality.
 This potential overestimation does not change the qualitative picture of
 the results, which is built upon comparison of relative values between
 the presence and absence of interventions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our results align with previous simulation studies of potential COVID-19
 interventions in similarly densely populated, low-resource settings where
 informal settlements are present, such as urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa.
 In these settings, social-distancing is demonstrated to be an effective
 intervention, and even small changes are estimated to have large effects
 on outbreaks

 as low as 5-10 tents per 1000 camp residents.
 After conversations with camp managers, we found that this intervention
 is more likely to be accepted in NW Syria than evacuation to community-based
 isolation centers.
 Community-based isolation not only poses cultural challenges; the capacity
 required to implement it has hardly been met

One of the key parameters we assessed for the implementation of self-isolation
 is the need for carers.
 In considering one carer per isolated individual, with daily contact in
 a buffer zone, once a certain threshold of isolated cases (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

200 per camp of 2000) is surpassed, the benefits of isolation begin to be
 outweighed by an increase in infectivity resulting from a growing number
 of exposed carers.
 This pitfall could be circumvented through the creation of a more organized,
 dedicated group of carers, thus reducing the number of healthy younger
 adults in contact with isolated (infectious) individuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting up a safety zone has two positive effects that most stand out: a
 reduction in the probability of an outbreak in the vulnerable population,
 and an increase in the time until the number of symptomatic cases peaks.
 Much of the success or failure of the safety zone intervention hinges on
 the functioning of the buffer zone.
 The number of inter-zone contacts per week, the implementation of health
 checks, and potential lockdowns all have notable effects.
 Also important is the portion of the population that is protected; protecting
 only the vulnerable may have the most beneficial effects, but it is precisely
 these vulnerable individuals, older adults and people with comorbidities,
 who may most need family members to care for them.
 While safety zone scenarios that allow greater numbers of family members
 to accompany their vulnerable relatives to the green zone may confer greater
 epidemiological risk, they may also engender greater well-being and social
 cohesion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite these benefits, we do not observe a clear decrease in IFR with this
 intervention, although it is possible that our model may overestimate mortality
 from an outbreak in the green zone in the few instances when there is one.
 Since it is unlikely that the camps have the economic means to increase
 the number of tents when implementing this intervention, we assumed that
 individuals do not reduce their contacts when moved to the green zone since
 household sizes will not decrease, which implies an increase in the number
 of contacts between vulnerable individuals.
 Despite this increase in contacts, we do not observe an increase in mortality
 in the vulnerable population when the safety zone is implemented.
 These results address concerns raised around this type of intervention
 from previous experiences with large numbers of fatalities registered in
 nursing-homes in developed countries 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dahab_covidIDPcontrol_2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While nursing-homes in developed countries may be seen as analogous to
 the safety zone intervention, the alternative to nursing homes in developed
 countries for the elderly population typically involves remaining at home
 with few contacts with younger individuals (in a scenario of lockdown),
 while in the camps the alternative is living in tents shared with younger
 individuals with high contacts rates (especially children).
 This may explain why we observe a positive effect from this intervention
 despite a relative increase in contacts among the more vulnerable subpopulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An instrumental consideration for our models is the fraction of the population
 recovered from COVID-19 after a steady state is reached.
 Although the duration for which SARS-CoV-2 infection confers immunity is
 uncertain, the proportion of the population recovered after an outbreak
 should play a role in its protection against future ones.
 For all intervention except self-distancing >30%, we observed that the
 fraction of the population recovered meets or exceeds 70%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important consideration for interpreting our results are the modelling
 assumptions we made.
 From the point of view of our parameterization, perhaps the most relevant
 relates to the relative transmissivity of the different infectious stages,
 whose specific values still have large margins of variability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "widders_viralLoadVsInfect_2020,casey_presymptEstim_2020,he_temporal_2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is particularly relevant for our purposes, because the higher the
 relative infectivity of the presymptomatic and asymptomattic stages, the
 less effective our non-medical interventions which rely on identification
 of symptomatic individuals will be.
 For instance, Bullock et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bullock_IBM4IDPs_covid21"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 assumed a higher infectiousness of the presymptomatic stage and hence self-isol
ation of symptomatic individuals had little effect.
 Self-isolation also becomes ineffective under the assumptions made by Hernandez
-Suarez et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hernandez_Refugee_covid20"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 when they considered isolating only severe symptomatic cases (whose fraction
 is small), hence mildly symptomatic individuals were effectively considered
 asymptomatic.
 On the otherhand, Gilman et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gilman_IBMrefugee_covid20"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 showed that self-isolation was effective when considering individuals at
 different stages to be equally infectious.
 We assumed that presymptomatic individuals have the highest relative infectivit
y, consistent with the most recent estimations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "casey_presymptEstim_2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, and the interventions we proposed are still effective.
 Considering a different scenario in which all compartments are assumed
 to be equally infectious, our interventions become even more effective

\begin_layout Standard
It is also important to acknowledge the benefits and limitations of different
 possible computational implementations.
 For instance, there are interventions that do not have a natural implementation
 within our framework, such as those requiring interventions targetting
 very specific interactions between individuals (as opposed to large groups
 of individuals).
 An example might be the isolation of an individual and his/her family,
 as proposed in Gilman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gilman_IBMrefugee_covid20"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 which, since we do not explicitly model interactions at the family-level,
 would require the creation of as many classes as families.
 When this level of detail is required, individual based models (IBMs) may
 be more appropriate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gilman_IBMrefugee_covid20,bullock_IBM4IDPs_covid21"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, IBMs require a rich amount of data for their parameterization
 which, although increasingly available, is scarce for IDPs.
 Our framework is powerful enough to simulate a large number of scenarios
 with little computational cost, which would be an optimal strategy as a
 first approximation in the design of interventions to narrow down the most
 relevant scenarios (as a reference, in <24h we model with just 12 cores
 75 scenarios requiring quarter million simulations).
 The scenarios selected could then be further investigated with more detailed
 interventions using IBMs, if data is available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key limitation of our approach is that it simulates an outbreak started
 by one infectious individual in a single camp with a closed population.
 We acknowledge that this approach does not fully capture the complexities
 of the NWS region, where IDPs live interspersed throughout the region in
 several hundred camps.
 The dynamics of an outbreak in the region are undoubtedly influenced by
 inter-community contacts, and the dynamics of an outbreak in a single camp
 by these region-wide dynamics, as it has been demonstrated in other countries
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gatto_spread_2020,arenas2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We expect our results to be robust to changes in population, as long as
 these changes are relatively small compared to the total population size
 in the camp, implying sporadic inputs of infected individuals.
 This is the expected behaviour in IDPs, which are often small and located
 in rural areas, and in which important population movements, as those observed
 in large camps, are infrequent.
 This fact, together with the relatively young population in IDPs, may help
 in limiting the impact of the disease, as observed in African rural areas

\begin_layout Standard
Other unaccounted for social and cultural dynamics will undeniably complicate
 the feasibility of our proposed interventions.
 Only one example we have not addressed here is the unlikeliness of children
 under 13 self-isolating.
 Although the number of challenges to implementing our proposed interventions
 are potentially endless, the community-based nature of our approach may
 help circumvent these challenges much faster than healthcare-based intervention
s, which often depend on complex political decisions and may take years
 to build the requisite capacity for an effective response.
 If the dynamics of the virus are well understood by local communities and
 at least some of the interventions we propose are implemented, the impacts
 of COVID-19 can be mitigated even in an environment as challenging as NW
 Syria.

 of external authority.
 
\change_unchanged
empowering local communities themselves is perhaps the best, if not the
 only way, to help them avoid the worst consequences of the pandemic.
 
\change_inserted 227091064 1615578513
Such an approach may achieve greater compliance with non-pharmaceutical
 interventions, especially where there is a mistrust of external authority.
 
\change_unchanged
This not only applies to IDP camps in NW Syria, but more generally to refugee
 camps in conflict-torn regions, and potentially other informal settlements
 and vulnerable communities around the world: the low-cost, effective interventi
ons we present are feasible, needed and urgent.

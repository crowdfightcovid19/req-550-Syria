	abstract = {The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy prompted drastic measures for transmission containment. We examine the effects of these interventions, based on modeling of the unfolding epidemic. We test modeling options of the spatially explicit type, suggested by the wave of infections spreading from the initial foci to the rest of Italy. We estimate parameters of a metacommunity Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered (SEIR)-like transmission model that includes a network of 107 provinces connected by mobility at high resolution, and the critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We estimate a generalized reproduction number (R0R0{\textless}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}R{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}0{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater} = 3.60 [3.49 to 3.84]), the spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix that measures the potential spread in the absence of containment interventions. The model includes the implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy (February 21, 2020) and runs until March 25, 2020. We account for uncertainty in epidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and awareness-dependent exposure probabilities. We draw scenarios of different containment measures and their impact. Results suggest that the sequence of restrictions posed to mobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced transmission by 45\% (42 to 49\%). Averted hospitalizations are measured by running scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the imposed restrictions and total about 200,000 individuals (as of March 25, 2020). Although a number of assumptions need to be reexamined, like age structure in social mixing patterns and in the distribution of mobility, hospitalization, and fatality, we conclude that verifiable evidence exists to support the planning of emergency measures.},

	abstract = {Background: Knowing the prevalence of true asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases is critical for designing mitigation measures against the pandemic. We aimed to synthesize all available research on asymptomatic cases and transmission rates. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe PMC for primary studies on asymptomatic prevalence in which (1) the sample frame includes at-risk populations and (2) follow-up was sufficient to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed-effects and random-effects models. We assessed risk of bias by combination of questions adapted from risk of bias tools for prevalence and diagnostic accuracy studies. Results: We screened 2,454 articles and included 13 low risk-of-bias studies from seven countries that tested 21,708 at-risk people, of which 663 were positive and 111 asymptomatic. Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed using a real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction test. The asymptomatic proportion ranged from 4\% to 41\%. Meta-analysis (fixed effects) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 17\% (95\% CI 14\% to 20\%) overall and higher in aged care (20\%; 95\% CI 14\% to 27\%) than in non-aged care (16\%; 95\% CI 13\% to 20\%). The relative risk (RR) of asymptomatic transmission was 42\% lower than that for symptomatic transmission (combined RR 0.58; 95\% CI 0.34 to 0.99, p = 0.047). Conclusions: Our one-in-six estimate of the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission rates is lower than those of many highly publicized studies but still sufficient to warrant policy attention. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in subpopulations such as children, to better understand how asymptomatic cases contribute to the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infection of the respiratory tract that emerged in late 20191,2. Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8\% of cases with severe courses, and 6.1\% of cases with critical courses3. This severe presentation may result from the virus using a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4; the same receptor tropism is thought to have determined the pathogenicity—but also aided in the control—of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20035. However, there are reports of cases of COVID-19 in which the patient shows mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which suggests the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6–8. There is an urgent need for information on virus replication, immunity and infectivity in specific sites of the body. Here we report a detailed virological analysis of nine cases of COVID-19 that provides proof of active virus replication in tissues of the upper respiratory tract. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms, with a peak at 7.11 × 108 RNA copies per throat swab on day 4. Infectious virus was readily isolated from samples derived from the throat or lung, but not from stool samples—in spite of high concentrations of virus RNA. Blood and urine samples never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by the presence of viral replicative RNA intermediates in the throat samples. We consistently detected sequence-distinct virus populations in throat and lung samples from one patient, proving independent replication. The shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50\% of patients (and by day 14 in all patients), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild illness of the upper respiratory tract. The confirmation of active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract has implications for the containment of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Background Long-term shedding of viral RNA in COVID-19 prevents timely discharge from the hospital or de-escalation of infection prevention and control practices. Key questions are the duration and determinants of infectious virus shedding. We assessed these questions using virus cultures of respiratory tract samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients as a proxy for infectious virus shedding.Methods Clinical and virological data were obtained from 129 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (89 intensive care, 40 medium care). Generalized estimating equations were used to identify if viral RNA load, detection of viral subgenomic RNA, serum neutralizing antibody response, duration of symptoms, or immunocompromised status were predictive for a positive virus culture.Findings Infectious virus shedding was detected in 23 of the 129 patients (17,8\%). The median duration of shedding was 8 days post onset of symptoms (IQR 5 – 11) and the probability of detecting infectious virus dropped below 5\% after 15,2 days post onset of symptoms (95\% confidence interval (CI) 13,4 – 17,2). Multivariate analyses identified viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies/mL (odds ratio [OR]; CI 14,7 (3,57-58,1; p\&lt;0,001) as independently associated with isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract. A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0,01 (CI 0,003-0,08; p\&lt;0,001) was independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2.Interpretation Infection prevention and control guidelines should take into account that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 may shed infectious virus for longer periods of time compared to what has been reported for in patients with mild COVID-19. Infectious virus shedding drops to undetectable levels below a viral RNA load threshold and once serum neutralizing antibodies are present, which warrants the use of quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological assays in test-based strategies to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and control precautions.Evidence before this study We searched PubMed, bioRxiv, and medRxiv for articles that reported on shedding of infectious virus in COVID-19 patients using the search terms (“coronavirus” OR “SARS” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “COVID-19”) AND (“shedding” OR “infectivity” OR “infectious” OR “virus culture”) with no language or time restrictions. A detailed study on nine patients with mild COVID-19 reported that infectious virus could not be isolated after more than eight days of symptoms. The probability of isolating infectious virus was less than 5\% when viral loads dropped below 6,51 Log10 RNA copies/mL. Similar results were obtained with a larger diagnostic sample set, but that study did not report on clinical parameters such as disease severity. Finally there is a report of a single patient shedding infectious virus up to 18 days after onset of symptoms. No published works were found on the shedding of infectious virus in patients with severe or critical COVID-19, and no published works were found on factors independently associated with shedding of infectious virus.Added value of this study We assessed the duration and determinants of infectious virus shedding in 129 patients with severe or critical COVID-19. The duration of infectious virus shedding ranged from 0 to 20 days post onset of symptoms (median 8 days, IQR 5 – 11). The probability of detecting infectious virus dropped below 5\% after 15,2 days post onset of symptoms (95\% confidence interval (CI) 13,4 – 17,2). Viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies/mL were independently associated with detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract (odds ratio [OR]; CI 14,7 (3,57-58,1; p\&lt;0,001). A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0,01 (CI 0,003-0,08; p\&lt;0,001) was independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2.Implications of all the available evidence Infection prevention and control guidelines should take into account that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 may shed infectious virus for longer periods of time compared to what has been reported for in patients with mild COVID-19. Quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological assays should be used for test-based strategies to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and control precautions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work partially was funded through EU COVID-19 grant RECOVER 101003589.

Results We included 29 studies reporting culturing or observing tissue invasion by SARS-CoV in sputum, naso or oropharyngeal, urine, stool, blood and environmental samples from patients diagnosed with Covid-19. The data are suggestive of a relation between the time from collection of a specimen to test, cycle threshold and symptom severity. The quality of the studies was moderate with lack of standardised reporting. Twelve studies reported that Ct values were significantly lower and log copies higher in samples producing live virus culture. Five studies reported no growth in samples based on a Ct cut-off value. These values ranged from CT \&gt; 24 for no growth to Ct \&gt; 34 or more. Two studies report a strong relationship between Ct value and ability to recover infectious virus and that the odds of live virus culture reduced by 33\% for every one unit increase in Ct. A cut-off RT-PCR Ct \&gt; 30 was associated with non-infectious samples. One study that analysed the NSP, N and E gene fragments of the PCR result reported different cut-off thresholds depending on the gene fragment analysed. The duration of RNA shedding detected by PCR was far longer compared to detection of live culture. Six out of eight studies reported RNA shedding for longer than 14 days. Yet, infectivity declines after day 8 even among cases with ongoing high viral loads. A very small proportion of people re-testing positive after hospital discharge or with high Ct are likely to be infectious. Conclusion Prospective routine testing of reference and culture specimens are necessary for each country involved in the pandemic to establish the usefulness and reliability of PCR for Covid-19 and its relation to patient factors. Infectivity is related to the date of onset of symptoms and cycle threshold level. A binary Yes / No approach to the interpretation RT-PCR unvalidated against viral culture will result in false positives with possible segregation of large numbers of people who are no longer infectious and hence not a threat to public health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Protocolshttps://www.cebm.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Protocol-Analysis-of-Transmission-Dynamics-of-COVID-1.pdfFunding StatementThe reviews was partly funded by NIHR Evidence Synthesis Working Group project 380 and supported by the Maria and David Willets foundation.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Not applicable.

	abstract = {Importance Knowing the transmissibility of asymptomatic infections and risk of infection from household and community exposures is critical to SARS-CoV-2 control. Limited previous evidence is based primarily on virologic testing, which disproportionately misses mild and asymptomatic infections. Serologic measures are more likely to capture all previously infected individuals.Objective Estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from household and community exposures, and identify key risk factors for transmission and infection.Design Household serosurvey and transmission model.Setting Population-based serosurvey in Geneva, SwitzerlandParticipants 4,524 household members five years and older from 2,267 households enrolled April-June 2020.Exposures SARS-CoV-2 infected (seropositive) household members and background risk of community transmission.Main outcomes and measures Past SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed through anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by ELISA. Chain-binomial models based on the number of infections within households were used to estimate extra-household infection risk by demographics and reported extra-household contacts, and infection risk from exposure to an infected household member by demographics and infector’s symptoms. Infections attributable to exposure to different types of infectious individuals were estimated.Results The chance of being infected by a single SARS-CoV-2 infected household member was 17.2\% (95\%CrI 13.6-21.5\%) compared to a cumulative extra-household infection risk of 5.1\% (95\%CrI 4.5-5.8\%). Infection risk from an infected household member increased with age, from 7.5\% (95\%CrI 1.3-20.3\%) among 5-9 years to 30.2\% (95\%CrI 14.3-48.2\%) among those ≥65 years. Working-age adults (20-49 years) had the highest extra-household infection risk. Seropositive household members not reporting symptoms had 74.8\% lower odds (95\%CrI 43.8-90.3\%) of infecting another household member compared to those reporting symptoms, accounting for 19.6\% (95\%CrI 12.9-24.5\%) of all household infections.Conclusions and Relevance The risk of infection from exposure to a single infected household member was four-times that of extra-household exposures over the first wave of the pandemic. Young children had a lower risk from infection from household members. Asymptomatic infections are far less likely to transmit than symptomatic ones but do cause infections. While the small households in Geneva limit the contribution of household spread, household transmission likely plays a greater role in other settings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study grants from Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, Swiss School of Public Health (Corona Immunitas research program), Fondation de Bienfaisance du Groupe Pictet, Fondation Ancrage, Fondation Privee des Hopitaux Universitaires de Geneve, and Center for Emerging Viral Diseases.
